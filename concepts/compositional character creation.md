When you're making a tabletop character, usually there's a few choices you need to make that configure the character: species, class, clan, whatever. Stuff like that. Compositional character creation is the idea that you put those decisions at the forefront, and center your character creation process around that.

In other words, instead of rolling your character sheet with dice and then picking what you want to do with the results, a compositional process would start with your choices and *that* would determine how your character is built.
