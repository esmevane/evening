First, here's some definitions:

- **Pre-made kits.** That's stuff like comprehensive stat blocks, incredibly detailed maps, beat-by-beat campaign guides, and other really cool game play aids.
- **Improvisational tools.** 

On the surface those two things seem pretty similar, right? They definitely are. In fact, pre-made kits *are* improvisational tools. However they have sort of a limit in how useful they can be to organic improv, because although they often provide reference for predictable scenarios, they tend to be difficult to leverage when things go off the rails.

Often, given the same pre-made kits, two games with two different narrators will play out wholly differently. The reason for that is this: improv is at the root of tabletop game play, and if you've ever role-played at any point, you've had to improvise. Each of those two games differs chiefly due to the improvisational intuition and experience of the different groups.

The act of favoring the design of improvisational tooling over pre-made kits isn't necessarily about making up new improv tools. More, it's about codifying and capturing that intuition and experience in a fun way, so more people can access it. Favoring that process over making pre-made kits simply says this:

> When given the choice between making up a bunch of stat blocks, or outlining a fun way to conjure up a stat block on-the-fly, go for the second option.
