Providing a sandbox and instrumenting the first moments of a story might be good ways to set a game in motion, but they aren't enough to sustain that motion. Great narrators provide consistent fuel for game play inertia, spotting sluggish moments and moving them along or cutting scenes. Without it, even some of the best sessions can grind to a halt.

Some definitions:

* **Narrative phases.** A narrative phase is a clearly defined moment in the story. It has a purpose and fits in with the other phases in obvious ways. For example, the three-act structure is a set of narrative phases describing the beginning, middle, and end of a story.
* **Backpressure.** Backpressure is any moment where instead of you doing something with a system, the system pushes you along instead. For example, when some program or other sends you a notification. Backpressure lets a system nudge you along in without any human or narrative cause.

In some of the best games, inertia keeps coming and the story seldom lags. Play is continual and fluid. Often we owe that to the skill of the narrator, but it's possible to structure a system so that it has that kind of inertia built in. That's where narrative phases and backpressure come into play.
## Narrative Phases

With narrative phases, a game system provides concrete moments with a well-communicated purpose. Now instead of _only_ proceeding through game play in scenes (which are _still around, and still useful_), games can proceed in well-defined phases. Those phases have an express purpose, and an obvious start and finish:

- You enter a "planning phase" in order to plan your heist.
- You enter the "preparation phase" before the battle.
- You enter the "wrap up phase" to tie up loose ends after a political intrigue.

Naming and defining the scenes, turning them into phases, and telling everyone about how they work, creates a socialization of the game concepts inside them. We turn them into significant parts of the game that people know how to interact with. It lets us put phases in books and distribute them in written form, most of all.
## Backpressure

Backpressure is the technique of creating a sequence of consequences that emerge organically through natural game play. With it, we turn normal interactions into key moments in a cause and effect loop. Anything can feed into this cause and effect loop, so long as it creates the impression of the world responding to player choices.

One of the most common ways we already feature backpressure in games is the general cause and effect of dice rolling. You roll good, something good happens, and something bad happens when you roll badly. Backpressure as a design technique applies that cause and effect to more things.

The net result of creating more clearly defined backpressure points is that they serve as cohesive improv prompt points for a narrator. With a robust and clearly defined backpressure structure, the narrator of a game gets prodding on when to make the game world change in response to the players (or something else).

Coupled with phases, backpressure can be narrowed into more specific genres of application too. You can establish backpressure frameworks for specific game formats, and specific narrative phases within them. So cause and effect in exploration and travel might be very different for intrigues or heists.
## But really

Again, none of this is new or invented stuff. Loads of game tables do have a socialized concept of game phases, or a discipline surrounding backpressure. The principle isn't to create new ones, it's to codify them when we see them. To put them into word and let other people see them.

Communicating phases and backpressure techniques in rulebooks can be boring for someone who knows how to do it already. So they can skip that stuff unless they need it for reference. But, for a first time reader, knowing these tricks can be the difference between an alright tabletop introduction, and a great one.
