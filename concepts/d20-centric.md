A d20-centric system is based around a single die resolution mechanic, specifically a twenty-sided die. In the tabletop world, d20s are common tools for resolution, even though you have to go to specialized shops to get them.

**Some interesting balance facts about the d20.**

1. 100 is divisible by 20, meaning you can think of it as a percentile die that moves in increments of 5% (100 divided by 20 = 5).
2. Because of that, you can model out your system in percentage bumps of 5%. That means any time you look at a roll, or a target number, or any number, really, you can map it to a percentage. Just multiply by 5.
3. The inverse works, too. If something only works 60% of the time, it has a target number of 12.
4. Because of that, you can confidently govern the outer bounds of your system. For example, you can say you won't let a given part of a character add more than +30% to a dice roll. That means the max it can give is +6.
5. Similarly, you can estimate the gravity of other dice as well, now. A d4 paired with a d20 means you've improved chances by +5% to +20%. And so on.
6. Because of all this, you can link in other systems of any sort, as long as you can model that system out in a way that translates to 5% steps.

In other words, a d20 centric design does a lot of work for you as a game developer. There's entire categories of balance and design that you simply don't need to worry about anymore, like you would with other die systems. It lays bare your intuitive model and gives you room to design kits with a little more numeric fidelity.

> It isn't so much that the other systems are flawed: they aren't! Rolling dice is fun and rolling a bunch of dice is a bunch of fun. Getting odd results is fun! A d20-centric design simply says: **make the core concept simple**.
