When characters interact with a world, they take things from it and leave impressions behind. These little facts begin to accrete around the characters, and the longer they exist, the more facts there are. Ten foot pole, rope in the knapsack, initials carved on a tree in the forgotten wood, and things like that.

Where does it all go? How do you keep track of it all?

Games and play shouldn't be an obligation, and they shouldn't introduce a problem where a few folks take on a ton of work so other folks can have fun. 

Everyone should have fun.

Reducing paperwork means creating structures that work on behalf of the players and narrators of a game, so they don't need to track as much.
