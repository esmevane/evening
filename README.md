## Overview

Evening is a story-forward narrative game system, with a tactical 

tabletop game engine with a focus on dramatic play, improvisational tooling, and fun, obvious mechanics.
## Lineage

Evening is made from smashing together some of the best and most popular tabletop systems, all open sourced. The most notable three origination systems are:

- [The 5th Edition SRD](https://dnd.wizards.com/resources/systems-reference-document), which lays the foundation of the core framework, which is a [[d20-centric]] tactical game with a [[level-based progression]].
- [Blades in the Dark](https://bladesinthedark.com/basics), a narrative game about a circle of scoundrels trying to make their mark on a rad ghost city. Blades gives us the idea of [[narrative prompt back-pressure]], and [[improvisational tools over premade kits]].
- [The Cypher System](https://csol.montecookgames.com/), which itself is a narrative focused d20-centric general framework. From Cypher, we take the concept of [[compositional character creation]], and the idea of [[tiered difficulty ladders]].

## What you're looking at

This is the source repository for Evening, an open source tabletop roleplaying game engine.

**If you're good with a browser**, hopefully you can click around and read some interesting stuff. If you're looking at it on Github, it should be mostly legible!

**If you like making up stuff of your own**, hopefully the stuff in here is useful for you. Everything in here is licensed CC-BY-SA, do whatever you like and don't forget about us when you make it big.
### Obsidian

This is all managed with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) based text editor. It's not meant to be deployed as a site or anything like that. It's just a bunch of documents that get their editing tracked in git.

Practically speaking, that means that if you grab Obsidian and look at this repo with it, it looks nicer.
## Contribution

So, can you lend a hand, offer feedback, stuff like that? Hell yes. That's awesome. File an issue, add to a discussion thread, push up a pull request. It's all docs, you might break stuff but then again, you might not.
### Rules of the Repo

1. There's a code of conduct. Do read it as you'll be held to it.
2. Keep the folders shallow and wide, meaning try not to go more than 3 levels deep. Instead, use tags to organize and manage spaces otherwise. Makes stuff easier to find later.
3. Mess with larger space structure as little as possible, please. The `.obsidian` config folder is checked in to git for now but if that wallops folks' setup too often, it'll change.
## Feedback

issues or the Discussion board here are probably the best places for feedback, for now. If more locations become available, they'll be included here.
## Credit & Copyright

Evening is a derived work. It has plenty of its own invention, but it stands on the shoulders of three giants. Without these works, Evening wouldn't be what it is.
