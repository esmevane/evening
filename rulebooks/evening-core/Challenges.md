The most interesting characters are prone to getting themselves into tricky scenarios.

- It's the middle of the night and you race along a rainy slope, something horrifying and loud clamoring behind you.
- You dive back and forth between two smoldering sabotaged airships, trying to stop the fire and keep them aloft, salvaging what remains of the precious art within them.
- You've just realized the wedding party is full of hidden killers, and you need to quietly identify them and neutralize them without the gentry realizing the danger.
- You've come across a strange cryptogrpahic cipher etched in glowing cyan stone in the heart of the maze. Every time you touch it, it gets a little redder, and you realize it's ticking down towards something ominous.

Each of these are **challenges**, a scenario where you must try to creatively problem solve however you can, and not necessarily just through hacking and slashing your way through. Puzzles, traps, dangers, intrigues, each of these fit as challenges.

Challenges present significant scenes as moments of tension which must be met or else avoided entirely. They put together the results of a bunch of checks, and let them build towards a single resolution.

Use challenges whenever:

- Combat doesn't make sense, but something big is happening.
- Combat *does* make sense, but something big is happening *as well*.
- Life and death are on the line.
- One simple action isn't even close to enough.
- You don't care how the characters do it, just that they get creative.
- There's a chance of failure.
- You want to add tension to the session.

## How Challenges Work

A challenge consists of a few parts:

- Its **scenario**, the actual problem or tension the characters are faced with.
- Its **threat**, which is what will happen if the challenge isn't met and resolved.
- Its **resolution**, or what happens whenever the challenge is overcome.
- Its **rating**, which determines how difficult the challenge is to deal with.
- Its **complexity**, representing how much effort the challenge will require.
- Its **urgency**, representing how pressing the challenge is.

A challenge's scenario, threat, and resolution are all largely just short summaries of the problem space, generally you can even put them in a single sentence.

"The glowing cube in maze (scenario) will detonate, obliterating everyone (threat) unless safely defused (resolution)."

**Rating.** The challenge's rating is a number from 1-10, and determines the base target number for any checks characters make to resolve the challenge.

**Complexity.** The challenge's complexity is also a number from 1-10, but this determines how much effort the challenge takes to resolve. Complexity sets the number of successes required to resolve the challenge, and how many failures will end the challenge unsuccessfully.

**Urgency.** This is a timeframe, like *scene*, or *evening*, or *month*, or otherwise it is *none*. Challenges can expand to any length of time if you allow them, and sometimes that's okay for some of them. Other challenges, however, are very finite. Whenever a challenge's urgency is met, if it hasn't already been resolved, it ends and its threat occurs.

## Meeting a Challenge

Any kind of aptitude check may be made to meet a challenge. There's no real restriction on how characters can choose to interact with the challenge, though some checks are more suitable than others.

**1. Decide on the aptitude.** The player describes how their character will meet the challenge, and what aptitude they will use.

**2. Determine target number.** Figure out the base target number for the check (the challenge rating x 3), and then modify it based on how suitable the aptitude used is.

**3. Make the check.** The player makes their character's aptitude check against the resulting target number.

- **If the check succeeds.** Mark successes in a tally: the amount is determined by the effect level. If the total number of successes tallied equals the success threshold, the challenge is resolved.
- **If the check fails.** Mark a failure in a tally. If the number of failures tallied equals the failure threshold, the challenge's threat occurs.

**4. Keep trying, or give up.** If the challenge isn't resolved or ended, the characters can either give up or try some more. Giving up means the threat takes place. If they keep trying, start over and keep going until the challenge ends, resolved or otherwise.
