Focuses are powerful specializations or knacks that distinguish you from the your peers. Focuses are part of the [[Progression|progression]] of characters which reflects specializations in your chosen classes, or devotion to a new distinct kind of power entirely.

**At first level.** At third level, you gain one focus level. You also gain the focus kit of the focus you select.

**At higher levels.** As you progress, you gain additional focus levels at 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th character level. You can spend those to increase the level of your current focus or you can choose to purchase a new focus which you are qualified for.

**Multi-focus.** You may pick to advance any focus you like whenever you spend an focus level.

**Re-designing your focus.** Whenever you would gain an focus level, you may exchange one focus level that you have already spent for a different focus that you qualify for. You have learned something new and chosen to put aside something you no longer wish to do.
