Evening is a tabletop roleplaying game with a focus on dynamic narration, fun tactical gameplay, and easy improvisation.

An evening session plays like this:

1. An ideal group of people, say 3-6 stalwart chums, get together for an evening of play, called a session.
2. Everyone either brings their normal characters already made with that group, or makes new ones for the session.
3. Once everyone is gathered, everyone decides on a format together. Formats tell you what kind of game the session will be. Exploration, combat, social intrigues, heists, and so on.
4. After deciding on the format, the evening begins.

Evening is designed to get you from zero to gameplay with zero prep and minimal bookkeeping. It wants your nights to be as fun and game-focused as possible. The ideal Evening session is one you play entirely off the cuff, with little planning, just because you feel like it in the moment.

Evening plays like most tabletop games: pen & paper, this document, some dice, and some friends are all you need to play. Evening is directly descended from 5E, and has loose, but not total, compatibility with it as a result.

One concept that Evening brings to the table which is (so far) unique to it is the conceit of *formats*. Put simply, formats are styles of play. Tabletop games are ambient things, with loose structure and many work like sandboxes, where you can do anything you want.

Without discarding that essential sandbox nature of tabletop games, Evening puts goals and purpose in front of a game group. With formats, it gives your session purpose and an agenda, a loose scaffold that helps you keep games in motion, and fun.
