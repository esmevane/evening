Evening is a zero prep tabletop roleplaying game with a focus on dynamic narration, fun tactical gameplay, and easy improvisation.

Any typical evening session plays like this:

1. A group of people, usually around 3-6, get together for an evening of play, which we call a session.
2. Everyone either brings a character from previous games, or makes a new one for the session.
3. Once everyone is gathered and ready, the group decides what blueprint to use for the session. Blueprints tell you what kind of session the evening will be. Blueprints are a layer over the base game that give it phases, and structure. Each has its own challenges and rewards, and helps the narrator drive the game with zero prep.
4. After picking the blueprint, the evening session begins, starting with the beginning phase of the blueprint.

Evening is pen & paper tabletop game much like any others. What distinguishes Evening is its focus on zero prep gameplay. Everything in the system is designed to enable you and your friends to hop into games with no warning, and improvise it from start to finish, without lots of planning, bookkeeping, and foreknowledge.

Evening plays in a traditional tabletop fashion, with paper, this document, some dice, and some friends. It doesn't need maps, miniatures, digital companions, or any of that. If all you've got is some dice and paper and your imagination, you're set.

Most of Evening's design hinges around the idea of *blueprints*. Put simply, the blueprint of an evening determines how a session works by providing it with phases and tension / reward structures. Evening offers a small, generalized collection of example blueprints, but you can easily make your own.

It's through the structure of blueprints that Evening empowers you and your friends to just make things up. Where a general tabletop game is an ambient, free-form thing, a blueprint for your session tells you what's coming next, and how to get there. Some example blueprints are: dungeon crawls, exploration, homesteading, social intrigue, heists, sabotage, questing, statecraft, and skirmishes.

However, Evening doesn't force you to play the blueprints only. You don't even have to play the same blueprint every session. You can free-form if you like, for as long as you like, and reach for blueprints as you need them. Whatever you need to keep your game in motion, and fun.
