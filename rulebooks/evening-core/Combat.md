Combat is a form of structured play around skirmishes and quick-paced close conflict. It typically models some kind of violence, and tends to end when one or more members of the conflict are subdued, or dead.

**Initiative-based.** Combat is initiave-based play, and heavily relies on actions, movement, and rounds.

**Melee combat.** Whenever you are adjacent to your target, you are in melee range and use melee combat rules to fight them.

- **Weapons.** If you are in melee range, you may use melee weapons to make a melee attack. Attempting to use ranged weaponry in melee range imposes disadvantage on the attack roll.
- **Reach.** If you use a melee weapon or have features that grant you a melee reach greater than 1, you may strike anything within that range with melee attacks.

**Ranged combat.** Whenever you are at a distance greater than close, you are outside of melee range and use ranged combat rules for conflict.

- **Range.** You may make ranged attacks only against targets which you can see within the range specified of your weapon. Some ranged weapons have multiple ranges: a short range and a long range. Whenever you make an attack with the long range, your attack has disadvantage.

**Combat actions.** Combat actions are actions which are mostly relevant during combat, though they may be used any time you like. Using a combat action when outside of initiative begins initiative before it resolves. Some combat-specific ations include:

- **Attack.** As an action, you may make an attack. Choose a target within your weapon's range, and roll your relevant attack aptitude against the target's defense TN. If you hit, roll the damage specified by the weapon to determine how much health the target loses.
	- A natural 20 is a critical hit. Critical hits always hit. Double all damage dice before determining damage.
	- A natural 1 is a critical miss. Critical misses always miss.
- **Attack of opportunity.** When a target moves in a square adjacent to you, either past you or away from you, you may use your reaction to make a single melee weapon attack against them.
- **Defend.** A an action, you make a defensive stance. You may add 3 to any defense checks made until the beginning of your next turn.
- **Disengage.** As an action, you disengage from combat. You may not be targeted by attacks of opportunity until the beginning of your next turn.
- **Off-hand attack.** Whenever you take the attack action with a one-handed melee weapon, you may use your bonus action to make a second attack with a second one-handed melee weapon.
- **Grapple.** As an action, you may grapple an adjacent target which is your size or smaller. Make a [[Prowess]] + [[Body]] + [[Athletics]] check against the target's TN. If against another player, this is a contested check. Success subjects the target to the [[Conditions#grappled|grappled]] condition. While grappling, your speed is halved.
- **Shove.** As an action, you may shove an adjacent target which is your size or smaller. Make a [[Prowess]] + [[Body]] + [[Athletics]] check against the target's TN. If against another player, this is a contested check. Success subjects the target to the [[Conditions#prone|prone]] condition, or pushes it one square away from you, your choice.
