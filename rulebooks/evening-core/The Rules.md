**The narrator & the players.** One person at the table is the *narrator*. This person is in charge of playing the *world*, and manages the gameplay itself. They conduct the story, play the non-player characters, track the tensions, make moves after character actions, and manage blueprint phases.

The rest of the group are *players*. Each player constructs one character (see [[Character Creation]]), and plays that character. The players are in charge of engaging with the game, working together, dealing with in-game tensions, and moving the story forward.

**The rule of cool.** The main point is to have fun together. If it isn't fun anymore, recalibrate; pause the game and have a real people chat with each other. Take a break and come back when it's fun again. Be kind to each other, help each other out, use safety tools, be respectful.

**The narrator has the final say.** The narrator may disregard or overrule any rule they like, for any reason, at any time. If the players don’t agree, wait until the scene or session’s end to discuss the disagreement.

**The rule of specificity.** More specific rules or systems beat more general ones. For example, broadly speaking, most living creatures are vulnerable to the impacts of poisons, but specific creatures or characters may have a feature which allows them to ignore impacts from poisons. In that case, the more specific ruling takes precedence and the actor is immune to the poison’s impact.

**Just round down.** Fractional outcomes are always rounded down. Things *aren't* until, at last, they *are*.

**Discuss safety tools before play.** Safety tools are things which help us avoid weird or un-fun game moments. This is a game, and it shouldn't make people feel bad or unhappy that they're playing. Safety tools help us communicate the things we do and don't want in our games. 

Some useful safety tools to bear in mind:

- *The "X" card*. This is a prop that lets people quickly respond to uncomfortable or bad moments in a scene's content. It doesn't have to be an actual "X" card, but it often is. The "X" card goes in the middle of the table. If something happens in a scene which anyone finds uncomfortable personally, they can touch the card. If they do, gameplay stops, and an out of character discussion happens about the problem content. Everyone decides together what to do next: rewinding, changing the scene contents, or skipping the scene entirely.
- *Lines and Veils.* This is a series of topics that everyone discusses before play. Lines are things that should never come up in gameplay, often this includes things like graphic violence, maiming, any kind of involuntary removal of individual autonomy (slavery, or mind control), strong adult content, or even something more benign, such as characters not working as a team. Veils are things which are permitted, but can only occur "off camera", meaning scenes including them generally end or fade to black, and the group skips to the aftermath. Veils often include things like acts of sex, drug use, or torture.
- *Session Zero.* This is the first game session, and it happens before anyone plays. Sometimes session zero becomes actual gameplay, but often it is just a conversation between everyone before the game, where everyone agrees on character concepts, what they want from the game, the game world, and so on. Session zero is the ideal time to talk about safety tools as well. Establish your lines and veils, and talk about the "X" card during the session zero.

**Responsible player engagement.** Narration can be a busy role. You need to manage communication with a number of people, do rules arbitrage, reference and track a bunch of game details, and so on. Evening tries to make this role easy as possible, but rules can only do so much. The rest of it boils down to your table, and its players.

Players should be ready to participate proactively, not passively, in the game:

- *Pay attention.* Don't wander off physically, or mentally. Put your phone and browser away unless you need to look something up.
- *Be ready to act.* While you don't need to be doing something, you should always be ready to do something. Do your best to know what's going on.
- *Share the spotlight.* Conversely, don't make it all about you. Remember to collaborate, include others, and help other players enjoy the game.
- *Keep your own books.* Don't make the narrator do it all. Track what you have, keep some notes on the world, do your own rule reference lookups.
- *Work together.* Don't betray, or steal, or refuse to work with other characters for any reason. Even if your character is antisocial, find an in-game reason why they like the other characters and stick around, supporting them.

Most importantly, as a player, *engage with the story*. Your character is a part of the game world, and your job as a player is to get involved. The narrator can only do so much to move the story forward without your active participation.
