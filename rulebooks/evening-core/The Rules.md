**The rule of cool.** The main point is to have fun together. If it isn't fun anymore, recalibrate; pause the game and have a real people chat with each other. Take a break and come back when it's fun again. Be kind to each other, help each other out, use safety tools, be respectful.

**The narrator has the final say.** The narrator may disregard or overrule any rule they like, for any reason, at any time. If the players don’t agree, wait until the session’s end to discuss the disagreement.

**The rule of specificity.** More specific rules or systems beat more general ones. For example, broadly speaking, most living creatures are vulnerable to the impacts of poisons, but specific creatures or characters may have a feature which allows them to ignore impacts from poisons. In that case, the more specific ruling takes precedence and the actor is immune to the poison’s impact.

**Just round down.** Fractional outcomes are always rounded down. Things *aren't* until, at last, they *are*.
