Origins are part of the [[Progression|progression]] of characters which reflects their ancestry, inheritance, and mastery of self. Origins grant you abilities and grow as you do, as you learn more about who you are and what you're capable of.

**At first level.** At first level, you gain one origin level. You also gain the origin kit of the origin you select.

**At higher levels.** As you progress, you gain additional origin levels at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th character level. You can spend those to increase the level of your current origins or you can choose to purchase a new origin which you are qualified for.

**Multi-origin.** You may pick to advance any origin you like whenever you spend an origin level. You have discovered a part of yourself that you didn't know was there and it has become a part of your life, whether or not you like it.

**Re-designing your origin.** Whenever you would gain an origin level, you may exchange one origin level that you have already spent for a different origin that you qualify for. This moment reflects a discovery of self that fundamentally evolves who you are as a person.
