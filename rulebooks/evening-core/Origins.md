Origins are the part of [[Progression|feature progression]] which reflect a character's identity and self-actualization. Origins grant you features and grow as you do, as you learn more about who you truly are, and what you're truly capable of. We grow and change over time, and the mutability of origins reflect that.

Origins can describe where a character comes from, such as their ancestry, culture, or magical lineage. However, they can also describe things that happen during the course of a character's life, such as discovered spiritualities, and deliberate or unintentional transformations. It is just as common for characters to reshape their origins as they go, as it is for others to have origins which stay the same.

**At first level.** At first level, you gain one origin rank. You also gain the origin kit of the first origin you select with this rank.

**At higher levels.** As your character level progresses, it grants you additional origin ranks. You gain an additional origin rank at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You may spend these to increase the rank of any origin you already have ranks in, or you may choose to purchase new origins which you are qualified for.

**Multiple origins.** You have no limit on the number of origins you may put ranks in, except for the requirements of those origins, if any, and the number of total origin ranks you have earned.

**Self-discovery.** Whenever you gain a new origin rank, you may also exchange one origin rank that you have already spent for a different origin which you qualify for. This reflects a moment of self-discovery, a new fundamental understanding of who you are as a person.

**Anatomy of an origin.** Origins are diverse in what they cover, but share an overall anatomy in how they impact characters. When creating your own origins, use this as your starting point.

*Name.* Origins have a name of their own.

*Description.* An overview of the origin, describing what they are, and disclosing any information about the origin that will help a player make a character for that origin.

*Traits.* Some traits that every member of this origin shares. This can be details about physique or lifespan for ancestries, or details about beliefs or ceremonies for cultures. Traits do not impact a character mechanically unless they are represented as a feature, or reflected in the origin's kit or rank progression.

*Origin kits.* An origin kit is a set of bonuses that a character receives if they take that origin when they choose their first origin rank at character level 1. It has the following:

- *Attribute bonus.* +1 to either Body, or Mind.
- *Starting assets.* +2 to one asset, and +1 to a second, different asset.
- *Aptitudes.* A list of 3 aptitudes. When recording this kit, the player may choose +1 aptitude from this list.

*Origin progression.* Origins give bonuses to characters as they invest origin ranks in them.

- *Assets.* Characters gain +1 to a given asset as they increase their origin rank past the 1st rank.
- *Features.* Origins have features which they grant to characters. These are specific to the origin. If the origin has traits that should have some kind of mechanical impact on the character, describe those traits as features.
