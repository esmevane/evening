How characters, threats, vessels and vehicles, and other things get around during initiative is managed by the movement and range abstractions. Movement isn't dealt with in a precise way, but instead modeled in a way that makes it easier to manage in the moment, and simpler to fit into the narrative.

**Squares.** Movement can be managed in abstract in one of two ways: theater of the mind, or by map. In both cases, units of movement are referred to as "squares", which roughly equals a square meter.

- For maps, a given square is directly equivalent to a square or hex on the map.
- For theater of the mind, movement in squares helps decide how much must be spent to cross distances, but it is the narrator's job to track position.

**Speed.** Everything which can move has a *base speed*. Your base speed equals how many squares you can move during your turn when in initiative. In order to move one square, you must spend one speed. At the beginning of every round, you regain all spend speed.

**Kinds of movement.** Different things move in different ways. Whenever something has multiple kinds of movement, each is listed along with its speed. For example, if something can fly, its speed would be something like "base (8), flight (10)".

Some common kinds of movement are: flight, climbing, swimming, and burrowing.

**Difficult terrain.** Difficult terrain, winds, waters, etc., double the cost of movement, requiring 2 points of speed for each square.

**Range.** A range is a band of distance. Everything within and up to a certain distance from you is within that range. So, something within 20 squares is "medium range".

**Movement actions.** Movement specific actions include:

- **Dash.** As a bonus action, you can spend up to your base speed in additional movement.
- **Get up.** You may spend 2 speed to get up, removing the [[Conditions#prone|prone]] condition.
