Characters can't go non-stop; they need rest. The world may go on and on, but taking a breather and getting a moment to yourself has to happen, just the same. There's two kinds of rest that directly benefit characters: short rests and long rests.

**Short rest.** Your characters take a little bit of downtime in a safe shelter, for at least an hour, and do nothing tougher than eat, drink, read, chat idly, or tend wounds.

At the end of the short rest, your character may spend some of their [[Reserves|reserves]] in order to recover health. Roll a number of die for each reserve spent, adding your [[Resolve]] + [[Body]] to the result of each. Your character regains that much health.

**Long rest.** A long rest is an extended period of downtime at least 8 hours long, usually devoted to at least 6 hours of sleep. The other 2 hours can be chatting idly, eating, or standing watch. If interrupted with any kind of strenuous activity, the long rest must be restarted in order to attempt it again.

At the end of the long rest, your character regains all health and reserves.

Your character can't benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and must have at least 1 health at the beginning of the rest in order to gain its benefits.
