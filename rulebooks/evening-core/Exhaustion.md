Your characters often tend to aggressively push themselves through the course of the game, burning the candle from both ends, so to speak. Exhaustion is a way of measuring how worn out your characters get, either organically or because of some kind of enemy feature or other.

Some things which can cause exhaustion:

- Failing to take a long rest every 24 hour period.
- Traveling in extreme weather, for example scorching heat or freezing cold.
- Going hungry for too long.

**Levels of exhaustion.** Exhaustion is measured in levels, from 0 to 6. Each time you gain a level of exhaustion, that number goes up. Whenever you reach a new level, you suffer an additional penalty as a result, outlined in the level.

**Recovery.** Exhaustion is permanent, but certain things can reduce levels.

- Certain mechanics or features may reduce exhaustion.
- Finishing a long rest reduces exhaustion by one level, provided you have nourished (had enough food & water to survive).
