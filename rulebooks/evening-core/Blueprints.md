Planning out sessions can be tough for narrators, and players as well, to some degree. To help with that, some game systems provide premade stories, or in-depth instructions on how to plan things out. In the interest of its zero-prep philosophy, though, Evening has blueprints.

Blueprints give you concrete things to do, resources to manage, unique gameplay mechanics, and success or failure conditions to resolve it all. They each fit into the base preparation-showtime-downtime loop of the Evening session, allowing you to either focus on one or batch a few up and do several at once. Each session can have different blueprints, based on the kind of game you feel like playing right then and there.

**The anatomy of a blueprint.** Blueprints are a structure designed to hook into the structure of play, and define what kind of game each given session is. They provide some detail around how exactly they hook into the preparation-showtime-downtime loop, and they also describe the kinds of game they create for everyone.

Each blueprint defines the following:

- *Name.* The blueprint's name.
- *Setup.* What the preparation phase looks like for this blueprint. This will let you know what you need to define in order to get going with the blueprint, how to set up any of the blueprint resources, and so on. Setup establishes base resources and kicks off any tensions which the characters must resolve during showtime.
- *Showtime.* The actual play structure of the blueprint. This section outlines how the blueprint's specific framework of play works, how characters can interact with the blueprint, and so on. Showtime ends when all the tensions established in setup are resolved, whether or not they succeeded.
- *Wrap-up.* Wrap-up describes any resolution and aftermath of the blueprint which occurs during downtime. Any resource-specific scenes occur here, as well as any blueprint-specific resource moves.
- *Resources.* Blueprints define resources that the characters and narrator may leverage, similar to assets. Resources wax and wane during sessions, only really replenishing during blueprint play.
- *Moves.* Each blueprint grants a set of blueprint-specific moves to both the characters and narrator. For characters, these moves describe the unique ways that characters and the world interact with blueprint gameplay and resources. For the narrator, blueprint moves are a set of events specific to the blueprint.

**Examples.** Some example blueprints could be: heists, mysteries, pursuits, homesteading, exploration, dungeon crawling, warfare, intrigue, statecraft, research, invention, questing, and so on.

**Combining blueprints.** Some blueprints are suitable to combine, for example, research, invention, and intrigue could all feasibly be played at once. It's up to your group, and your imagination, whether or not you want to play multiple blueprints in a given session or not.

**Making your own blueprints.** Evening provides a few general blueprints as examples, and you're encouraged to use them as you like or make your own, unique to your game story.
