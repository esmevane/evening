- [ ] Focus is now Devotion.
- [ ] Formats are now Blueprints. Other suggestions that I liked were: Plans, Schemes, Scripts, Programs, and Patterns.
- [ ] Origins, Classes, Devotions, and Disciplines no longer have "levels", they have ranks. This is so that we can distinguish between character level and character option choices.
- [ ] Introducing: Moves. Moves are Ranked action structures that have three effect outcomes: miss, partial, and full. Blueprints, Aptitudes, and Resources grant moves to players, and Blueprints, Threads, Challenges, Dangers, and Threats grant moves to the narrator.
- [ ] Moves are very notably *not* granted by Origins, Classes, Devotions, or Disciplines. Those choices adjust the general framework that the character works in, and so they influence moves indirectly in that way, but ranks in those are meant to adjust the dynamic of the character through feature kits.
- [ ] Dangers, Threats, and Challenges now have Moves instead of baked in damage and actions. Every time a character takes a turn, or activates other triggers, the narrator picks one move for a danger/challenge/threat that the characters face and makes it.
