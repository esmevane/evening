- [ ] Focus is now Devotion.
- [ ] Aptitudes listed in main document.
- [ ] Formats are now Blueprints. Other suggestions that I liked were: Plans, Schemes, Scripts, Programs, and Patterns.
- [ ] Origins, Classes, Devotions, and Disciplines no longer have "levels", they have ranks. This is so that we can distinguish between character level and character option choices.
- [ ] Inclusion of generic character options for origins, classes, devotions, and disciplines, as well as aptitudes, assets, and related moves.
- [ ] Inclusion of "how to create your own" instructions for origins, classes, devotions, and disciplines.
- [ ] Introduce stress, a new kind of injury/exhaustion track.
- [ ] Introducing: Moves. Moves are Ranked action structures that have three effect outcomes: miss, partial, and full. Blueprints, Aptitudes, and Resources grant moves to players, and Blueprints, Threads, Challenges, Dangers, and Threats grant moves to the narrator.
- [ ] Moves are very notably *not* granted by Origins, Classes, Devotions, or Disciplines. Those choices adjust the general framework that the character works in, and so they influence moves indirectly in that way, but ranks in those are meant to adjust the dynamic of the character through feature kits.
- [ ] Dangers, Threats, and Challenges now have Moves instead of baked in damage and actions. Every time a character takes a turn, or activates other triggers, the narrator picks one move for a danger/challenge/threat that the characters face and makes it.
- [ ] Rearrange document to feature character options before the rules. Previously it was Intro, Basic Rules & Structure, Character Options, Tensions (Combat etc), Narration. The new order is Intro, Character Options, Tensions, Structure, Narration.
