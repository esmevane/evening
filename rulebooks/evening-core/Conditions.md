Conditions are placed on creatures or objects and modify their capabilities in different ways. Conditions modify something else, and are often descriptive of the lasting impact of magic, storylines, or combat.

**Are conditions bad?** Conditions are simply changes of state, neither good or bad. Often whether or not a condition is helpful or not is... well, conditional.

**Removing conditions.** Conditions specify the circumstances for their own removal, and may also be countered or expire as specified in whatever event that applied the condition to begin with. Otherwise, conditions do not have an overarching duration.

**Stacking conditions.** Conditions have no magnitude or stack, inherently. Something either has the condition or it doesn't. More severe versions of the same condition are often modeled as different conditions.
