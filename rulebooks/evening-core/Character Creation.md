Building an Evening character is usually about picking a few key things and then gradually defining the details later in play. So, to begin with you don't have a whole lot to do other than deciding what your foundation looks like.

The process works something like this:

1. You pick your starting abilities: **[[Finesse]]**, **[[Prowess]]**, **[[Resolve]]**. You begin with -1 in each, and have 4 points to distribute.
2. Pick your starting attributes: **[[Body]]**, and **[[Mind]]**. You begin with -1 in each, and have 3 points to distribute.
3. Pick your beginning origin and class, applying the kits for each.
5. Pick 3 additional aptitudes you like from the options granted to you by origin and class.
6. Determine your health, aptitude bonus (+2), character level (1), and reserves.

**Optional: Level adjustments.** Usually Evening starts you at level 1, which assumes you're already well on your way. However, if your narrator wants, they can increase or decrease the level. For increases, this is more or less straightforward.

Your narrator can also begin the game at level 0. This is a special level where you have no aptitudes, 4 health, no reserves, and no significant possessions. Level 0 characters gain their first level upon completing their first challenge.
