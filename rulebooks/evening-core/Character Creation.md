Evening characters start out simple, to leave a lot of room for improvisation and gradual definition later. To begin with, you determine a few key things about your character's foundation. Most of it can be changed through character progression, as you learn more about what you want to play, and your character learns more about themselves.

To start a new Evening character, you do the following:

1. You pick your starting abilities: **[[Finesse]]**, **[[Prowess]]**, **[[Resolve]]**. You begin with 0 in each, and have 4 points to distribute.
2. Pick your starting attributes: **[[Body]]**, and **[[Mind]]**. You begin with 0 in each, and have 3 points to distribute.
3. Pick your beginning [[Origins|origin]] and [[Classes|class]], applying the kits for each. You can change origin and class later, if you like. See the rules for each for more information. Later, you can gain [[Discipline|disciplines]] and [[Devotion|devotions]], as well.
5. Pick 3 additional [[Aptitudes|aptitudes]] you like from the options granted to you by origin and class.
6. Log your starting health (determined by your class), aptitude bonus (+2), character level (1), and reserves.

**Changing ranks.** Whenever you gain a level that gives you a new feature rank (a new rank in a class, devotion, discipline, or origin), you may choose to change an existing feature rank of the same kind, exchanging it for a feature rank of the same kind.

**Optional: Level adjustments.** Usually Evening starts you at level 1, which assumes you're already well on your way. However, if your narrator wants, they can increase or decrease the level. For increases, this is more or less straightforward: just look at the character progression table and figure out how many ranks you have to allocate, and your aptitude bonus.

Your narrator can also begin the game at level 0. This is a special level where you have no aptitudes, 4 health, no reserves, and no significant possessions. Level 0 characters gain their first level upon completing their first thread.
