Reserves measure how much your character has left in them, how much harder they can push themselves or how much longer they can last.

**Base reserves.** Your base reserves are a pool of dice which come from your class levels. Every time you advance a class level, you add a new reserve die to your pool. That means that if you purchase levels in different classes, you could have a reserve pool with a bunch of differently sized dice in it.

**Buying extra reserves.** You can also invest 1 experience point to get an extra reserve die, up to 5 total experience points. The size of these additional reserves are the same as the largest kind of die in your reserves. For example, if you have 2d8 reserves and 1d10 reserves, any additional reserves from experience are d10s.

**Using reserves.** As you play, you can spend your character's reserves in a number of ways.

- After finishing a **short rest**, you may spend as many of your reserves as you like, recovering that much health.
- As a reaction, you may spend one of your reserves when making a **defense check**, adding the result to your check total.
- You may use a bonus action to ignore the effects of exhaustion for a round by spending one of your reserves.

**Recovering reserves.** You regain all spent reserves after finishing a **long rest**.
