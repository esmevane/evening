When reduced to 0 health, your character is struck unconscious. While unconscious, they are close to death and may no longer act. At this point, you have several options available.

**In initiative.** If you are in initiative, your options are constrained by the initiative. You may not act, but you still have turns within the initiative order. Your options are:

- **Character death.** You may choose for your character to die. If you choose this, at the end of initiative, your character dies.
- **Struggling to survive.** If you choose to attempt to survive, you begin making *death saves* on your next turn.

**Outside of initiative.** Outside of initiative, characters are more resilient. Unless killed outright, a knocked out character recovers at the end of a scene with one hit point.

**Non-player characters.** It's up to the narrator if a threat or non-player character perishes or gets death saves. Usually, they don't, but sometimes it makes sense narratively for non-player characters or threats to hang on to life harder.

**Killed outright.** If your character takes enough damage from a single source that meets or exceeds your total health, they are killed outright.

**Death saves.** If your character is struggling to survive, they begin rolling death saves. On your turn, **in front of everyone**, roll 1d20 with no modifiers.

- A roll of 1 is **two failures**.
- A roll of 2-9 is **one failure**.
- A roll of 10-19 is **one success**.
- A roll of 20 is **immediate recovery**.

If you roll 3 failures before you roll a 20, or 3 successes, your character dies. If, however, you roll 3 successes or a 20, you recover: you awaken with 1 health and may resume taking bonus actions, and reactions, *immediately*.

**Stabilize.** As an action, you may administer first aid to an unconscious target and try to stabilize it. Make a [[Resolve]] + [[Mind]] + [[Medicine]] check, TN 10. If successful, the target stabilizes. They are at no risk of death, but their health stays at 0 and they stay unconscious. They will regain 1 health and consciousness in 1d4 hours.
