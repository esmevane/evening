Your game can take you to a wide range of different places, each with its own properties and risks. In some games, the environments themselves are the antagonists of the stories. Below are some rules to navigate a few environmental perils.

**Falling.** Falling from a dangerous height, for whatever reason, results in 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet you fall, up to 20d6. You land prone, unless you avoid this damage somehow.

**Suffocation.** You can hold your breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + [[Resolve]] + [[Body]], but no less than 30 seconds.

Whenever you run out of breath or begin choking, you may survive a number of *rounds* equal to 1 + [[Resolve]] + [[Body]], with a minimum of 1 round. At the start of the next turn, you drop to 0 health and begin dying, and you can't regain health or be stabilized until you can breathe again.

**Vision.** For characters who rely on vision, the environment may interrupt line of sight or cause problems depending on visibility circumstances.

- In an obscured area, such as in dim light, patchy fog, or anything that disturbs vision a bit, you have disadvantage on aptitude checks which rely on sight.
- In heavily obscured areas, such as darkness, thick fog, and so on, your vision is blocked entirely. You have the [[Conditions#Blinded|blinded]] condition.

**Lighting.** How much or little light there is also plays into general visibility. There are four bands of illumination: blinding, bright, dim, and dark.

- **Bright** light is anything which allows you to see normally, for example, even lanterns or gloomy days, and so on.
- **Dim** light and **blinding** light create an obscured area. An example of dim light would be the area just outside of the torch light, for example. For bright light, it would be anywhere that the light is far brighter than normal.
- **Darkness** is the absence of most light, and creates a heavily obscured area. Darkness would be anywhere underground, or indoors with windows shuttered.

**Sustenance.** Eating and drinking or other kinds of sustenance are daily requirements. For every long rest you finish without engaging in some kind of daily sustenance, you suffer a level of exhaustion, which can only be removed after you've finished a long rest with sustenance.

- **Rations.** What a character needs as sustenance can vary, but is represented by the abstract unit *rations*. A single ration is enough sustenance for a day.
- **Half-rations.** You can stretch a ration by eating half-rations. You do not recover or lose exhaustion while substiting on half-rations. If you finish a long rest while subsisting on half-rations, you do not recover health or reserves at the end of the long rest.

**Interacting with objects.** Usually interacting with the world is a purely narrative thing. You tell the narrator what you're doing, the narrator lets you know what happens. Sometimes there's a consequence, and that is modeled out with other systems, usually aptitude checks.

**Harming objects.** You can damage objects if your character attempts to. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage, but otherwise they can be affected by attacks. The narrator can choose to give the object a TN and health, or they can model harming the object out as a [[Challenges|challenge]] if that makes sense.
