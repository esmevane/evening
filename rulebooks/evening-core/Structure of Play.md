By default, gameplay follows a sequence of play which has four major phases. It's possible to go through all four phases within a game session, but you can spend as much time as you like in each phase, so they can stretch out across multiple sessions if that's what makes sense.

**Format dependent.** By its very nature, the structure of play is ambiguous. This is because *what you do* in your game varies a lot based on the choices your players make when making their characters. 

1. Games begin in the **free play** phase. This is a mostly ungoverned phase of the game, designed to allow everyone to play and enjoy their characters and the world. Characters are in control here, deciding what to do, exploring, playing with their [[Threads|threads]], and living their lives. Free play ends when players decide they want to prepare to engage in one or several of their formats.
2. From there, the **preparation** phase begins. This phase begins once everyone playing has agreed to get ready for showtime, and it does the work to set showtime up. What goes into preparation is normally handled out of character, and it varies a lot based on the formats you pick for showtime.
3. Once preparation is complete, the **showtime** phase begins. Showtime throws the characters into the middle of the action which the setup and preparation phases arranged. Showtime explores the formats, and each format has its own parameters of play and resolution. Showtime ends when all formats have been resolved, successfully or not.
4. When showtime is over, **downtime** begins. This is the space between frames of action, where everyone returns to their home or base of operations. Here, the ramifications of what happened in showtime are given time to breathe. Like preparation, downtime plays out largely out of character, where players discuss what their characters go on to do. Resting, advancement, personal projects, all occur here.

**Cyclical.** The structure of play is cyclical. After downtime, everyone returns to free play until the next preparation phase begins.

**Optional.** All of this is *recommended play*, which is to say, it's only there to make coming up with games and playing them easier and more gamelike for everyone, even the narrators.

**Winging it.** Advanced game groups, or groups in advanced stages of their game, might feel like the structure of play is intrusive. If that's the case, throw out gameplay formats and structure, and wing it: traditional tabletop roleplaying often has no cohesive top-level structure. It's only about playing out a story. If that's what you want to do, nothing stops you.
