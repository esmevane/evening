Evening is a game of well-defined prompts and improvisational cues, and one major part of that is through *structured sessions*. Each given session is meant to be a cohesive game unto itself, with a clear start, and a clear resolution. This is accomplished through a system called *blueprints*.

**Blueprints.** Blueprints provide the structure of an Evening session, providing it with phases, and a framework sort of like a board game or a card game. Each Evening session can have one or more blueprints. These don't have to be the same as the last session's blueprints, nor the next.

**Start of the session.** When an Evening session begins, the narrator and the players have an out-of-game conversation about the which blueprints to pick for the session. This doesn't have to be the same as the last session. It's possible to pick a few blueprints, if that makes sense. It's also possible to pick none, and instead do some *free play*. Once everyone agrees on the session blueprints, the game can begin.

**Free play.** Although Evening provides the blueprint framework to make it easy to dive in and improvise different kinds of games, they aren't mandatory. If your narrator and players are happy just diving into the game and winging it, go right ahead. The blueprints will be there later if you find you need them.

**Starting the game.** Every blueprint has an opening sequence for your session, called *preparation*, which tells you how to jump in. If you've picked multiple blueprints, do preparation for all of the blueprints before beginning. The preparation phases are done out-of-character. You don't start roleplaying until it's showtime.

**Showtime.** Once you've finished preparation for your session blueprints, it's showtime. Everyone assumes character, and the first scene begins, determined by the blueprints' preparation outcomes. Often this will be *in media res*, or in other words, you'll just jump right in to the action.

- Showtime is split up into *scenes*. A scene works a lot like it would in a play or film, where each has its own setting and characters. Scenes aren't necessarily time constrained, though you can imagine a scene as being a few minutes to an hour.
- The blueprints you've chosen will generally tell you what kind of scenes you can expect, and how those scenes bring you closer to blueprint resolution.
- Once you've resolved all of your blueprints' scenes, successfully, or not, showtime ends and downtime begins.

**Downtime.** Downtime is a mix of in-character and out-of-character play, where you wrap up your session blueprints and conclude the evening's events. During downtime, the ramifications of showtime are given a little room to breathe. Resting, advancement, and personal projects all occur during downtime.

- During downtime, the players and narrators do any end-of-showtime book-keeping, such as gathering experience or spending it. Like preparation, this is mostly done through out-of-character discussion.
- The blueprints you've chosen will tell you what kind of outcomes to play through during downtime. These are generally done through short, self-contained, in-character scenes.
- Downtime can be used to do discretionary free play, where characters can further any of their ongoing agendas, storylines, or projects. This is also generally done through in-character scenes, and can sometimes be individual play.

As downtime occurs towards the end of the session, try and keep any in-character scenes brief. Otherwise, you'll risk dragging things on while the goal should be to try and wrap up.

**Cyclical.** The structure of play is cyclical. Any given Evening session starts at preparation and ends after downtime, and then the next session kicks off again at a new preparation. If you were to run long Evening sessions, you might go through more than one of these cycles.

**Storylines and threads.** During an Evening session, different scenes might further existing storylines and threads. These continue independent of the session blueprints, and interleave with all scenes. For example, the narrator might be tracking an encroaching doom, or the players might be tracking character projects. These can all advance as normal regardless of the blueprint, or during free play before or after the session blueprint.
