An aptitude is something you've learned to do, and become good at. It can be a whole lot of different things, for example: intrinsic skills, knowledge, tools you're good at, combat disciplines, and so on.

**Aptitude kinds.** Aptitudes are sorted into three kinds: **disciplines**, **skills**, and **knowledges**. These are thematic links more than anything else, though some features do key in to specific kinds of aptitudes and offer bonuses (or drawbacks).

- **Disciplines** are combat related, involving regimented practice until they become rote repetition.
- **Knowledges** are representative of a character's education, or their familiarity and proximity to information.
- **Skills** are practiced tricks or techniques that take something innate about the character and refine it into a tool.
- **Wealth** aptitudes are techniques of largely economic or societal worth, or else describe some odd knack that benefits the character considerably.

**Making aptitude checks.** A character either has an aptitude, or doesn't. There isnâ€™t an inbetween or gradual value, though some features will provide additional modifiers to the aptitude check.

Aptitude checks are made with the following formula:

- **With an aptitude:** Ability + attribute + aptitude bonus.
- **Without an aptitude:** Ability + attribute.

**Relationship with stats.** Aptitudes don't have an inherent relationship with abilities or attributes. Each check picks the three most relevant modifiers, and uses those. Players are welcome to suggest any combination they like, but the narrator has final say over which gets added to a check.

**Weird combos.** It's fine to make a check with weird combos. People are exceptional at creative application of the tools they have, and Evening characters are no different. That [[Prowess]] + [[Body]] + [[Arcana]] check makes a lot of sense in some scenarios, surely.

**Absence of aptitude.** In some cases, making a check without an aptitude will have other risks, or penalties. Those are outlined on the aptitude in question.
