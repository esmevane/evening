Most moments of tension or uncertainty are left to chance in the form of a d20 check. Other dice play into it as well, but the d20 is the most common.

- Anyone can prompt for a check. Often the system or the narrator will get things rolling here, but players can suggest one as well.
- The narrator thinks about how difficult the check should be, usually by consulting a rating level and modifying it. The narrator then decides what the starting effect is: usually this is *standard*.
- Based on how tough the check ought to be, the narrator will assign a target number. They don't have to say it out loud, but they can if they like.
- The player rolls d20, adding any relevant modifiers to the outcome.
- If the total rolled plus its modifiers beat the target number, the check succeeds. Otherwise, it fails.

**Target numbers.** The target number for the check (sometimes abbreviated as TN) describes how difficult or risky something is. The higher the number, the riskier or more challenging a task is. The lower, the simpler or safer. Narrators are in charge of finding target numbers whenever the rules don't outright specify one.

Here's a rough guideline:

![[Table - Target Numbers]]

**Low target numbers.** If the TN is incredibly low and there's no chance for failure, don't even bother rolling. The check can automatically succeed. However, if there's even a remote chance of failure, lean towards rolling anyway.

**Take effect.** If a check succeeds, it *takes effect*. Usually, this means you get a standard effect. However, effect varies on a number of factors. See the [[Effect|effect]] section for more information.

**Advantage and disadvantage.** In some cases, circumstance or a feature will let a character roll with advantage or disadvantage. In both cases, this means you roll 2d20 (which means two d20s at the same time). When you have advantage, you take the highest. When you have disadvantage, you take the lowest.

It's possible to stack a bunch of advantage or disadvantage factors. Advantage cancels out disadvantage, and vice versa.

**Modifiers.** Many things can modify the outcome of a roll, boosting or penalizing the result. These are called modifiers.

- **Abilities, and attributes.** You may add one ability and one attribute to any check which they apply. These stack.
- **Aptitudes.** Occasionally a character will have an aptitude with a kind of check. If they do, they may add their aptitude bonus to that check.
- **Assets.** You may *leverage an asset* in order to add it to a check. This can be done a number of times per storyline, determined by the asset. You may only leverage one asset per check. See [[Resources]] for more.
- **Features and circumstances.** These are powers characters may have, or general circumstantial benefits from anything, like items and things like that. Different features and circumstances stack.
### Group Checks

An entire group of characters might need to make a check, for example if everyone is attempting to navigate a hostile city while in disguise. In this case, the narrator sets a target number normally, but everyone in the group makes a check against that number. If more than half of the group succeed, the group check succeeds. Otherwise, it fails.
### Contested Checks

Sometimes a check is actively resisted. In the case of the narrator, this doesn't involve a roll, because it's handled with tension ratings. However, two characters can face off like this, and in those cases both of them make the same check, with the highest roll winning. If there's a tie, re-roll until it breaks.
