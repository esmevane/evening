Resources are tangible mechanics for ephemeral in-game rewards, both material and social.

Resources work by adding a new section to character sheets which functions kind of like Ability score modifiers. These values range from 0 to 5, but can go higher with supernatural help. Achieving key moments in a game can result in resource bonuses. For example, if you gain the trust of a neighboring monarch, you may gain +1 Influence.

You may use resources to help with specific checks that may be related. Often, like skill proficiencies, the resource itself will tell you what checks it helps with, but you may also negotiate with your GM if you like.

You may be proficient in resources. This works like any kind of proficiency. It doesn't exist as part of the core kit of the game itself, but you can house rule it in with several different approaches.

1. You may grant everyone 1 resource proficiency of their choice.
2. You may do the above, but constrain the choices by character background.
3. You may purchase resource proficiency instead of taking an ability score bonus or feat.
4. You may bundle resource proficiencies in with existing feats where it makes sense.

Using resources has a cost: every time you add a resource to a check, or make a resource check on its own, you reduce the resource modifier by 1.
