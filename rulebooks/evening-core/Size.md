Size is an abstraction that measures the space and relative load capacity you might have. Everything takes up some space, and has some amount of load capacity, and the modifiers and baselines for that vary mainly on your size.

|    Size    | Space | Load Capacity |
|:----------:|:-----:|:-------------:|
|    Tiny    |   1   |      +0       |
|   Small    |   1   |      +0       |
|   Medium   |   1   |      +1       |
|   Large    |   2   |      +2       |
|    Huge    |   3   |      +3       |
| Gargantuan |   4   |      +4       |

**Space.** The amount of space you take up is basically this: how many squares do you sit in? This is a square number, meaning if your space is 2, you take up 2x2 squares (4 total).

Space determines how much room you need to fight and maneuver effectively, and how much space you can control. It isn't specifically how big you are. It means when you occupy that space, no thing else can occupy it safely.

**Load capacity.** Your load capacity (as explained in [[inbox/core/Equipment|equipment]]) is modified by your size.

**Getting into smaller spots.** You can squeeze through a space that can accommodate a creature up to one size smaller than you are. Squeezing through small spaces like this is difficult terrain: it halves your speed, and you have disadvantage on attack rolls and [[Finesse]] defenses while you do it.
