Instead of making everything a pass / fail, checks, conditions and feature efficacy are both measured by degrees of success called **effect**. Effect maps circumstances and cheeck reesults into outcomes, and gives a way for the narrator, players, and the system to make roleplay organically impact things.

**Taking effect.** If something succeeds, it "takes effect". That means it achieves the baseline outcome, no better, no worse.

**Effect level.** By default, whenever something takes effect, it does so at the baseline effect level. Increasing the effect level means the action has more impact, and decreasing it means it has less.

Typically the effect level will be *standard*. However, the narrator should feel free to adjust starting effect according to what's going on in play. The more impactful player actions are, the higher the effect level, and vice versa.

**No effect.** Sometimes an action can have its effect reduced enough that it has no effect. Conversely, sometimes actions can succeed but *begin* at no effect (requiring effort to produce effect).

**Assessing effect.** Circumstances and intuition should heavily influence effect level. A few things positively and negatively influence effect levels. The narrator factors in everything and then adjusts the effect.

- **Potency.** Take into account the relative power and weakness of everything involved. Stronger people throw harder punches. Fire has greater effect on dry wood.
- **Quality / suitability.** The quality of something factors into effect. Using better tools (or weapons or armor) improves your effect. The opposite is true: poor tools hinder effect.
- **Scale.** The proportion of cause and effect, physical and otherwise, weigh in on effect as well. Titans do incredible damage when they stomp on you.
- **Stunts.** If the character pulls off something incredibly fun or cool, increase their effect level.

**Interpreting effect levels.** What effect levels *mean* is based on the context of the action or check. The overall effect something has is a measure of how impactful the action is, but this means different things. For example, if you're in combat, it might impact your damage dice, but if you're meeting a challenge, it might simply modify how many successes (or failures) you get for a check.

**Making checks.** Once you've assessed the effect, make a roll. The outcome of the roll has a further impact on the effect.

- If the result is 10 or more higher than the target number, increase the effect by one level.
- If the result is 10 or more lower than the target number, decrease the effect by one level.
- If the roll is a natural 1, decrease the effect by one level.
- If the roll is a natural 20, increase the effect by one level.

These are cumulative. So, for example, if you roll 10 or more lower and a natural 1, decrease effect by two levels.

**Increasing effect.** If a character feature would increase or decrease effect, it does so after the check is made and adjusts the effect only after everything else is considered.
