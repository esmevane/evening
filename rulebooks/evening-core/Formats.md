Formats are mix-and-match components which help you build out the structure of your game sessions. Based on your preference, your game will surface some formats that might be appropriate for your group. Formats give you concrete things to do, resources to manage, and success and failure conditions for play.

**What are formats?** Many roleplaying games follow particular game formats, so many formats will be familiar: the dungeon crawl format, the exploration format, the heist format. By naming the formats and giving them structure, they become deliberate parts of how you play your games.

**Is this it?** There's a few formats presented, mainly in tandem with classes, plus a few ambient ones. Of course it's not comprehensive. Formats are a design space, and one worth exploring further. Edit them, combine them, make up your own.

**Which to use?** What formats you pick for your games are completely up to you. A number of things will suggest formats to your group, and the [[Structure of Play|structure of play]] provides a way to pick different ones for different sessions. Ultimately formats make sense as building blocks to help you make your game your own. Pick the ones you want to play.

**Structure of formats.** A format has some distinct elements that it has to provide which let you use them in structured play.

- **Name.** The name of the format.
- **Setup.** The setup requirements: how you get started with the format in showtime. This isn't at all uniform, but depends more on the resources the format works with. For example, for a heist format, this might be: Deciding on what the heist is, deciding how to do it, and a roll to figure out how well (or badly) you kick off the heist.
- **Showtime.** This is the actual play structure of the format itself. This is an entire structure of rules that describes how the format works. It is the heist, itself, and it continues until resolved. Typically showtime is designed to engage the characters, present challenges to them, and drain their resources a bit. When showtime is over, the characters should be looking for an opportunity to rest.
- **Downtime.** When showtime is over, what does the format require for rest and recuperation? That's the downtime you need to specify for the format.

**Is mingling several formats too much?** That's up to you. Some combinations don't make sense, and those will be pretty obvious. Others do: dungeon crawls and heists combine well. Planar exploration and cosmic research combine well. Others dovetail one into the other: planar exploration and cosmic research might lead organically into a dungeon crawl or a heist.

Formats are a tool for you to design your gameplay. Explore them or pick some that you like and stick with them. It's your preference.
