Everything is interwoven, and even the most casual of moments can lead circuitously to unintended consequence. The general cause and effect that carries through your game, tying everything together, are called **threads.**

As the narrator, threads are there to help you track what's going on in the world and to help prompt you and your players. Make a thread whenever you want to track something significant going on in the foreground or background of your story. Whenever something significant occurs in your game, it can either further a thread or it could make a new thread. Whenever a thread ends, something major has occurred.

**Making threads.** Whenever you discover or create a thread, take a small piece of scratch paper–say, an index card–and write down the name of the thread on it. Give it a short summary of what's going on, and then write down a number between 4 and 12. The longer this number, the longer the thread will influence your game.

Finally, decide on an outcome: something which will happen if the thread resolves. This can be a good or bad thing, and largely decides how everyone responds to it.

**Threads and secrecy.** There isn't much point in keeping threads hidden. In the case of threads, a little in character and out of character blending makes sense. Threads are often tangible to the characters in the game, and so when you make a thread, tell everyone.

**Thread actions.** Threads influence your game world in a tangible way. Those moments where your plotlines influence your game are called *thread actions*. They can be good or bad, but they are often significant. Whenever something advances a thread, the thread makes an action of some kind.

**Advancing a thread.** Threads can advance through deliberate intent, accident, or entirely through random circumstance. Ultimately the narrator decides what thread advances and when, but many of these key moments may trigger a thread advance:

- Whenever someone rolls a natural 1, a thread might advance, and it might trigger a bad thread action. This might also happen if a check misses by 10 or more.
- Similarly, whenever someone rolls a natural 20, a thread might advance, this time in a good way and with a good action. This might also happen if a check succeeds by 10 or more.
- If a [[Challenges|challenge]] resolves or fails it could advance a thread.
- Through deliberate intent, for example if a character or antagonist works to advance the thread, doing something important or making a successful check, then advance it.
- At the beginning of a session, or scene, or during downtime, a thread might advance.

There doesn't have to be direct cause and effect for something to advance a thread. Two completely unrelated things can occur, governed simply by the whim of the cosmos.

When a thread advances, mark a tally on the thread to record the moment, and take a thread action.

Whenever you would advance a thread, you can of course also create a new thread instead.

**Forestalling a thread.** Sometimes the thread advancing is something the characters actively work to prevent. Whenever you might advance a thread, you can also decide that a thread is forestalled instead. When you forestall a thread, remove a mark instead of adding one.

**Threads move over time.** You may only advance a thread, forestall a thread, or resolve a thread a limited number of times, or else things begin to move too fast for the rest of the game world. After making two such marks, stop until the next scene.

**Resolving a thread.** When the thread has advanced to completion, it resolves. Whatever the thread foretold occurs, good or bad.

In cases where a thread is forestalled enough that it has no marks left, remove the thread. It is no longer a concern to the story. If it resurfaces organically later, make a new thread for it.

**Continuing threads.** Sometimes the resolution of the thread creates new threads. In those cases, if the link between threads is clear, then put the new thread directly on top of the resolved thread. This can be used to model out growing threats, new discoveries, and evolving plotlines.

**Player threads.** The narrator is in charge of tracking threads, but can create them for any reason at any time. Sometimes this reason will be because a player has requested it, for example to track projects or undertakings their characters want to engage in. These kinds of threads should be highly accessible to player interaction and checks, moreso than threads otherwise would be.

**Preparing actions.** If you want, you can prepare the actions a thread will take. In the area left under the resolution of the thread, write down the actions ahead of time. This can be extra useful in game prep, if you want to queue up some threads for use later and save some time in the game.

## Kinds of Thread

There's a lot of stuff you can model with threads, and if you're able to keep track of a variety of different kinds of threads, it'll make a tangible impact on how your games feel and their pacing as well.

Every thread is a mix of a few of these, really, but figuring out what kind of thread you want to make helps in those first few moments of defining it.

**Character.** Character threads focus on a given character. Whether or not it's a player character is significant, because if too many threads occur about side characters, they could steal the limelight from the players.

**Storylines.** Storylines are threads that depict a mounting plot or overarcing series of interconnected events. Storylines are things like looming disasters, prophecies, or the ironic tragedies that occur between neighboring kingdoms.

**Intrigues.** Sometimes characters are just up to something. Intrigues are threads that model out agendas being pushed by whoever, for whatever reason. When a faction moves, or someone hatches a dangerous and risky plan, you want an intrigue.

**Projects.** Sometimes the plot isn't an agenda, it's a creation. A magical working, an archaeological excursion, a hunt for an ancient library, a new invention, an art piece, a grand party. All of these are projects, and they can take front row of the game when done right.

**Problems.** Obstacles or impending dooms that are closing in on the characters make for great threads. These can be pretty short-term, only lasting for a few scenes, before resolving, or they can be huge session-spanning arcs that drive a lot of moments of consequence.

## Making Thread Actions

Putting a thread action into the world is ultimately something up to the narrator. Threads exist almost entirely as prompt structures to suggest times for the narrator to intervene in the story a bit, in fact.

With that in mind, though, here's some suggestions for things you can do when you make a thread action. These are all just suggestions, of course: thread actions ultimately are *features*, and interact with the world exactly like a feature should. That means that there is a lot of potential to structure a thread action and reuse it when you like, as you would any character feature.

**Exploding or suppressing outcomes.** Whenever someone makes a check, or the next time someone makes a check, you can either explode or suppress the outcome. If it would be only of minor importance, it instead sets off a huge chain of side-effects... or, if it were meant to be the master stroke in a huge plan, it fizzles for some reason or doesn't quite achieve what it should have.

**Pain or recovery.** Thread actions can do damage, and they can heal it. If you want to exact a price of some health, or return it, go ahead.

**Consequences and conditions.** Something tragic happening to a character, or exhausting them, or even bestowing some kind of condition on them, can be a reasonable result of a thread action.

**Complications.** Whenever someone tries to accomplish something, or if they would attempt to accomplish something soon, you can add a complication that makes that task much harder. At its surface, this could be as simple as assigning disadvantage, but in some cases it might make sense to introduce some genuine, tangible complexity that makes that undertaking harder.

**Losing or gaining opportunities.** Something in the background changes, either revealing a new opportunity or completely shutting one off. The characters are too late to do something they need to do, or else they arrive with ample time to prepare for an ambush.

**Giving or taking advantage.** As a distillation of the above, whenever a character next does something in the service of the thread, they gain advantage. Similarly, when they next do something to forestall the thread, they suffer disadvantage.
