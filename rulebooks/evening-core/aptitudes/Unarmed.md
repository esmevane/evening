Unarmed, also known as hand-to-hand, is an aptitude that describes how well-trained a character is in physical combat without any weapons. This can be punches and kicks, grappling, wrestling, or many forms of disciplined combat traditionally thought of as martial arts. Boxers, street fighters, peasant warriors, and so on, all often have some amount of unarmed aptitude. Whenever you need to identify an unarmed combat style, or fight someone in close combat without weaponry, use your unarmed aptitude.

**Using without aptitude.** If you try to engage in hand-to-hand combat without the unarmed aptitude, you do so with -2 modifying your check.
