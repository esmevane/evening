Nature is knowledge, practiced or discovered, which you have gathered over time about the world around you. It is an expression of what you know about the forests and the hills of the land, the flora and the fauna surrounding you, the patterns of weather and seasons, and the general interactions of ecosystems around you. Nature can help you identify safe or medicinal plants, and strange animals. It can also give you the wherewithal to know how to accurately describe or document new discoveries.
