For the protagonists of your game, it makes sense to build out in depth sheets. You want to get to know them, and you want to decide how they grow. But what about their opposition? What about the villains of the story, the dangers in the dark, the monsters just past the horizon?

When you need to create a theater of tactical combat for the characters to fight in, use threats. Threats are creatures that scale and award experience like [[Challenges|challenges]].

**Engaging a threat.** Threats are combat encounters. When you engage a threat, roll initative, and join combat.

### Threat Rating

Threats have a rating from 1-10. Rating sets a baseline for how deadly the threat is, determining the number of health dice it gets, and the base target number to avoid its attacks or hit it, its base damage.

![[Table - Threat Rating]]

**Health.** This is the health a threat starts at.

**TN.** Defending against threat attacks, and attacks made agains the threat are made against its TN.

**Attacks.** How many attacks the threat can make every round. How these attacks work are entirely up to you.

**Damage per attack.** Whenever a single-target attack lands, this is the damage it does.

> **Balance**
> 
> Balance on this is still rough. It isn't meant to be perfectly tuned, but it also shouldn't be a scenario where everyone dies instantly or kills the critter too damn fast. [Here's an anydice view into probability of various rolls against threats of a certain TN.](https://anydice.com/program/2def1) Much of the numbers in here began with this probability chart and an expectation of 3 rounds of combat for a base creature, +0-3 rounds for each added trait.

### Determining Strengths & Weaknesses

Generally, a threat should have one thing it's pretty good at, and one thing it's poor at. Figure those out when you make the threat. You can add more or reduce these, without changing the threat rating. It's up to you.

- Whenever the threat's strength applies, increase its target number by 6.
- Whenever the threat's weakness applies, decrease its target number by 6.

### Customizing Damage

To flavor the danger of your threat, you might want to change how its attacks work.

**Melee or ranged.** The range on any of these attacks can change without impacting things much.

**Multiple targets.** If an attack should damage multiple targets, halve the damage it does.

**Certain damage.** If an attack is unavoidable, halve the damage it does, and give characters the chance to make a defense check to halve the damage again.

**Boosting damage.** The amount of attacks aren't set in stone. Combine attacks together to create larger damage attacks. For example, a threat with 3 attacks at 3d6+4, can be edited to become a threat with 2 attacks, one at 6d6+8 and another at 3d6+4, without upsetting balance. 

**Exchanging damage.** Move dice and modifiers around between attacks. If a threat has 3 attacks at 3d6+4, change that into one at 5d6+6, one 3d6+4, and one 1d6+2.

**Damage types.** You can make this damage any damage type you like, or any mixture of types. Fire and cold? Go for it.

### Traits

Threats come in all shapes and sizes, and some qualities of a threat aren't directly coupled to its rating, but do impact how dangerous the threat is. Those scenarios are modeled with traits. A threat can have a bunch of traits, or none at all.

#### Behemoth

Behemoth threats are simply gargantuan in size. Double the threat's health.

#### Champions

Champions are formidable threats, capable of standing alone against an entire group. When you add the champion trait to a threat:

- Increase the threat's target number by +3.
- Double the damage from one of the champion's attacks.

#### Controller

The threat has two additional abilities.

- The threat may choose to slow targets instead of damaging them.
- The threat's ranged attacks become area attacks, affecting small ranges (either cones, or spheres). This does not decrease the attack damage.

#### Defender

Defender threats have a carapace or some other kind of evasive, or defensive boost. Add +3 to the target number required to hit them.

#### Lair

Lair threats have turned their lair into a stronghold which they may use to their advantage in combat. When lair threats engage in combat inside their lair, they gain acess to a lair action.

**Lair action.** You harness your lair to your advantage, either activating traps you've lain or through using its ambient magic or by simply using your home advantage in clever ways.

Lair actions occur on initiative count 20 (losing all initiative ties), and give you access to a list of lair action options determined by your lair.

You may use lair actions only if you would be able to use regular actions. If surprised, you may not use lair actions until after your first turn in combat.

#### Legendary

Legendary threats are far beyond their contemporaries in every way. Most fall when faced with a legendary threat. When you add the legend trait to a threat:

- Give the threat 3 legendary actions.
- Increase the threat's target number by +3.
- The threat gains 3 legendary resistances.

**Legendary actions.** Legendary actions are extra actions which can be taken outside of your turn, instead being used at the end of another creature's turn. Legendary actions return at the beginning of your next turn.

You may use legendary actions only if you would be able to use regular actions. If surprised, you can't use them until after your first turn in combat.

**Spending legendary actions.** Any normal action or bonus action the threat is capable of may be triggered with a legendary action.

**Special legendary actions.** Some legendary threats will have actions that may only be triggered with legendary actions. These cost 1-3 actions.

**Legendary action limit.** Unless spending it on something with a legendary action cost, the legendary threat may only use one legendary action at one time.

**Legendary resistances.** Whenever a character uses magic or a special attack on a legendary threat, it may spend one of its legendary resistances to ignore the effect instead.

### Nemesis 

Nemesis threats are calculating and plan their attacks out. Give a nemesis threat a special cascade of villain actions.

**Villain actions.** Villain actions are actions which set up greater and greater effects. They are calculating moves on a battlefield that result in catastrophic outcomes. Using a villain action takes the place of an attack. Only one villain action may be used per round. Villain actions have to be performed in order. 

1. Round one villain actions do half damage, but can place conditions or have small side-effects.
2. Round two villain actions can trade damage for effect, such as moving the threat or the targets to more advantageous positions.
3. Round three villain actions are explosive in nature, and do four times the damage or deal some catastrophic effect.

#### Phased

Phased threats gradually reveal more and more of their power as the fight goes on. Whenever they fall to 0 health, their health fully replenishes, and they gain new traits or abilities.

**Multiple phases.** Some threats have multiple phases. In these cases, every phase is unique. Remember, each phase adds a minimum of 3 or so rounds of combat on average, so overdoing multiple-phase threats should be reserved only for climactic conflicts.

#### Swarm

Swarm threats are easy to deal with on an individual level, but come in large numbers. Swarms share one health pool but attack in crowds. When you give the threat the swarm trait, mark down how many are in the swarm. Every 

**Many locations.** Swarms can move parts of themselves into different locations. Whenever anything except the heart location is hit, it perishes, and the swarm must move another there if it wishes to keep using actions there.

**Heart location.** Swarms have a "heart" that has full health. Finding and attacking the heart is the quickest way to defeat a swarm, and so it should be possible for characters to figure out where the heart is and navigate to it.

In cases where the swarm isn't actually a swarm–say, a small group of gremlins or something like that–the heart location is some kind of captain that the rest follow. In cases where the swarm *is* actually a swarm, it's usually some kind of pit or nest.

#### Vicious

Vicious threats are specifically dangerous and gain the following benefits:

- Double the damage the threat does per attack.
- They add +3 to the target number for their direct attacks.
