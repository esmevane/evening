As your character faces challenges, they grow and advance, gaining in capability and growing into different, evolved characters. Experience points are an abstract measure of how your character has grown and changed over time.

Towers tracks progression with experience points: every time a character resolves a challenge or storyline with a rating that meets or exceeds their current rating cutoff, their character marks one experience point. Every five experience points gained may be spent on a level during downtime.

**Gaining experience.** You gain one experience point if any of the following things occur:

- You resolve a challenge, threat, or danger with a rating equal to your **minimum advancement rating** or higher.
- You resolve a thread.
- The narrator decides to give you one.

**Using experience.** Experience matters in two regards:

1. As you accumulate experience, your *total experience* increases. This is used to determine your character's level. Every **5 points** of total experience you earn **levels up** your character by one level.
2. You may also invest individual experience points. This is a temporary allocation, though how often you recoup and adjust your experience investment is limited.

**Investment.** Investing experience allows you to adjust your character in unique ways, customizing them to fit your needs. During downtime, you may invest your earned experience in the following ways:

- You may invest up to **25 points** of experience adding dice to your reserves, at the cost of **5 points** of experience each. Added reserves are the same die size as your largest reserve die.
- You may invest up to **25 points** of experience increasing the permanent value of your **assets**, at the cost of **5 points** of experience per asset increased. You decide which asset to increase.
- You may invest **5 points** of experience to give a non-player character or object you can carry **plot armor**. The narrator may not directly harm or endanger things with plot armor, but in exchange they may not be used in initiative or to resolve challenges or threads.
- You may temporarily invest **1 point** of experience to increase the effect of a check by one step. Experience invested in this way is recovered at the beginning of your next downtime.
- You may temporarily invest **5 points** of experience to re-roll a check. You must take the new result. Experience invested in this way is recovered at the beginning of your next downtime.
- You may temporarily invest **5 points** of experience to ignore 1 level of injury or exhaustion until your next downtime. This level doesn't go away, but you act as though your overall injury or exhaustion were one less for determining effects. Experience invested in this way is recovered at the end of your next downtime.

**Recovering invested experience.** At the start of downtime, or upon resolution of a thread, you may choose to release up to **5 points** of invested experience. You lose whatever benefit you had invested that experience in, but recover the experience to invest in something else.

**Leveling up.** Whenever you spend experience to level up, you gain in strength, advancing up the character progression chart until you hit level 20. Different levels convey different perks. Your aptitude bonus grows, and you gain a number of features according to what level you've reached.

**Character progression.** As your character gains in levels, their aptitude bonus increases and they obtain new character features. However, their **minimum advancement rating** also increases, which means future experience can only be earned by meeting greater and greater challenges.

**Starting at level 0.** Some games kick off at level 0. This is a special level that offers no intrinsic bonuses at all. Unless otherwise stated by your narrator, level 0 characters become level 1 at the completion of their first storyline.

**The mechanics of leveling up.** Depending on the level you've reached, you gain new features and your character's options broaden. Several things happen as you level up:

- You gain access to new **features**, depending on the level you've achieved.
- Your **aptitude bonus** may increase. This bonus applies to any aptitude you have.
- Your **minimum advancement rating** may increase. As this number grows, the number of challenges you can advance from decreases, slowing your ability to earn experience.

**Gaining features.** As you achieve new levels, you gain features, many of which are called **feature levels**. Feature levels are smaller progression tracks that you can use to fine-tune your character. Much of what you are comes from the features and feature levels you choose.

- **Origin** levels grant you abilities that reflect the identity of your character, and grant you **resources** that allow you to navigate the world.
- **Class** levels grant important abilities to your character, reflecting the identity of your class. They also determine your combat baselines: **defense**, **health**, and **reserves**.
- **Discipline** levels grant you abilities related to your aptitudes, giving you an edge when using those aptitudes, and when you seek out or use **assets** and **wealth**.
- **Focus** levels grant you specialized abilities, distinguishing you from your peers in unique ways. Many focuses will be specializations of your class, but this is not a hard rule: some focuses build on origin, others disciplines, some none at all or a mixture of others.

**Feature levels.** You can advance features as you choose, using the levels you gain while your character advances. Feature levels obey a few rules:

- Any time you gain a feature level, you can spend that level to advance an existing feature of that kind or learn a new feature of that kind which you already have access to.
- The very first feature of a given kind that you buy gives you extra benefits, often in the form of access to aptitudes, assets, and resources.
- Whenever you purchase a feature with a feature level, its level increases by 1. That means if you use 5 discipline levels to buy 5 different disciplines, you are 1st level in 5 different disciplines. And vice versa.
