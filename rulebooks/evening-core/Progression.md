As your character faces challenges, they grow and advance, gaining in capability and growing into different, evolved characters. This is reflected in experience points, and character level.

**Character level.** Every character has a level, typically ranging from 1 to 20. You progress one level every *5 points* of *total experience* you gain.

**Experience points.** Experience points are an abstract measure of how your character has grown and changed over time. Evening tracks progress by awarding experience points.

Experience is tracked in two ways:

- *Total experience.* This is a sum of all experience points ever gained. This only ever goes up. Your total experience divided by 5 determines your character level.
- *Invested experience.* This is a pool of experience you can move around at key moments, to grow and develop your character. You have a number of experience points you may invest equal to your total experience.

**Gaining experience.** Characters gain experience by engaging with the game and helping other characters engage with it. Characters mark one experience point every time any of the following things occur:

- You resolve a tension with a rating equal to your *minimum advancement rating* or higher.
- You resolve a thread.
- The narrator decides to give you one.

**Using experience.** Experience matters in two regards:

1. When your *total experience* goes up, your character level might as well. Every *5 points* of total experience earned increases your character level by one.
2. You may *invest* your individual experience points. This allocation is temporary, and you may recoup and adjust how you invest it.

**Investment.** During downtime, you may invest your earned experience. Investing experience allows you to adjust your character as you like, customizing them as you play and learn more about who they are and their needs.

You may invest experience to do the following things:

- You may invest *5 points* of experience to gain an additional 1d8 of reserves. You may invest up to *25 points* of experience like this.
- You may invest *5 points* of experience to gain a permanent point in an asset. This point can take you beyond the limit of 5. You may invest up to *25 points* of experience like this.
- You may invest *5 points* of experience to give *plot armor* to a non-player character, or object which you can carry.
- You may temporarily invest *1 point* of experience to increase a check's effect by one step. Any experience invested in this way is recovered at the beginning of your next downtime.
- You may temporarily invest *5 points* of experience to re-roll a failed check. You must take the new result. Any experience invested in this way is recovered at the beginning of your next downtime.
- You may temporarily invest *5 points* of experience to ignore 1 level of stress, injury, or exhaustion until your next downtime. This level doesn't go away, but you can act as though your overall injury or exhaustion were one lower for determining any effects. Any experience invested in this way is recovered at the beginning of your next downtime. In addition, at the start of your next downtime, all mitigated levels of stress, injury, and exhaustion immediately return.

**Plot armor.** Plot armor blocks the narrator from harming or endangering something. However, in exchange, plot armor prevents anything it protects from being used in initiative or to resolve tensions.

**Recovering invested experience.** At the start of downtime, or upon resolution of a thread, you may choose to release up to *20 points* of invested experience. You lose whatever benefit you had invested that experience in, but recover the experience to invest in something else.

**Leveling up.** If you have gained enough total experience to level up, you gain any new levels at the beginning of your next session downtime. Whenever your character level increases, your character gains new perks, their aptitude bonus increases, and your minimum advancement rating increases according to their new character level.

**Minimum advancement rating.** Your character level determines what kinds of tension you gain experience from. You earn no experience from any challenge, danger, or threat with a rating lower than your minimum advancement rating.

![[Table - Character Progression]]

**Starting at level 0.** Some games begin before character progression, which is also called level 0. This is a special level that offers no intrinsic bonuses at all. Unless otherwise stated by your narrator, level 0 characters become level 1 at the completion of their first storyline.

**The mechanics of leveling up.** Depending on the level you've reached, you gain new features and your options broaden. Practically speaking, these things occur:

- You gain access to new *base features*, depending on your new character level. Base features are features which aren't tied to feature ranks.
- You gain access to new *feature ranks* of different kinds, allowing you to increase existing ranks, gain ranks in new features of the same kind, or rearrange existing feature ranks of the same kind. There are four kinds of feature ranks: origins, classes, disciplines, and devotions.
- You gain access to new *feature kits* of different kinds, allowing you to gain a one-time bonus to your character from a feature rank you've purchased.
- Your *aptitude bonus* may increase. This bonus applies to any check made with any aptitude you may have.
- Your *minimum advancement rating* may increase. As this number grows, the number of tensions you may resolve in order to advance goes down, slightly slowing your ability to gain experience points. This doesn't apply to any narrative threads or storylines you resolve, nor does it prevent the narrator from rewarding you bonus experience.

**Gaining features.** As you achieve new character levels, you gain *base features*, *feature ranks*, and *feature kits*. 

- *Base features.* These are features which aren't tied to specific kinds of ranked features. They are more generalized features which represent individual growth.
- *Feature ranks.* There are 4 kinds of *feature ranks*: origins, classes, disciplines, and devotions. As you gain character levels, you gain a number of ranks of these kinds to spend. Feature ranks represent a journey of self-discovery and power evolution, and often represent cultural, factional, or allegiances of some kind as well.
- *Feature kits.* The first time you spend a feature rank in a kind of feature, you automatically also gain the feature kit for that rank. This only occurs the very first time, and so if you change that feature rank later, you do not change kits. This reflects the moment in time where you first developed in this way.

**Kinds of feature ranks.** Inside of character level progression, you have different kinds of feature ranks. These are are smaller progression tracks that you can use to fine-tune your character. Much of what you are comes from the feature ranks you choose.

- *Origin* ranks grant you abilities that reflect the identity of your character, and grant you *assets* that allow you to navigate the world.
- *Class* ranks grant important abilities to your character, reflecting the kind of roles and playstyle that your character evolves into. Classes determine your combat baselines: *defense*, *health*, and *reserves*.
- *Discipline* ranks grant you abilities related to your aptitudes, giving you an edge when using those aptitudes, and when you seek out or use *assets* and *wealth*.
- *Devotion* ranks grant you specialized abilities, further distinguishing you from your peers, reflecting your deeper, individual passions and insights. Many devotions are specializations of origins, classes, or disciplines, or a mix of them.

**Advancing feature ranks.** You can advance features ranks as you choose, using the ranks you gain while your character advances whenever you gain them. Feature ranks obey a few rules:

- Any time you gain a feature rank, you may spend it to increase a feature rank of that kind which you already know, or instead learn a new feature of that kind, provided you have access to it.
- The very first feature of a given kind that you spend a rank in grants you a kit. The rank may be moved around later, but you only gain the kit for the first feature rank you buy.
- Whenever you purchase a feature rank, its level increases by 1. This means that if you spend 5 discipline ranks to buy 5 different disciplines, you are rank 1 in those 5 different disciplines. If, instead, you spend all 5 discipline ranks in a single discipline, you become rank 5 in that discipline.
