Harm and deadliness are tracked by measuring how much damage and health things have. Whenever you do harm, you are dealing damage. Whenever you suffer harm, you lose health. If something has a health pool, it can be 

**Health pool.** Your health pool is a resevoir of points that represent a bunch of concepts: will, luck, physical durability. It's important to reiterate that: **health is not just your physical condition, it represents a few things**. Instead of representing each of those things in separate pools, they're "tallied up" into a single pool.

**Current health.** Your health pool is split into two values: your maximum health, and your current health. Whenever damage of any sort occurs, it is represented as a loss of health from your current pool.

**Applying damage.** If something deals harm, it specifies how much damage it deals. This is typically a dice formula, like "2d6+2" ( or a flat value like "10") paired with a damage type. In order to determine the damage, roll the given dice, including any modifiers, and then apply the resulting damage to the target.

If a damage source would deal damage to multiple targets, roll the damage once and apply it to every target individually.

**Modifiers.** Some weapons, special abilities, or damage affinities apply to damage rolls. Modified damage results can deal 0 damage, but not negative damage.

- If the target has a **vulnerability** to the damage type, they take double damage from that damage type.
- If the target is **resistant** to the damage type, they halve damage from that damage type.
- If the target is **immune** to the damage type, they ignore damage from that damage type.
- **Critical hits** double the damage damage dice you roll to determine damage.

**Falling to zero.** Whenever you drop to 0 health, you are knocked unconscious and must proceed as outlined in the [[Death|death]] section.

**Healing.** Damage to health isn't permanent, and it fluctuates a great deal throughout conflict and stress. Healing can be represented by a lot of different things, and it can take many forms, just as health itself does. Certain features and systems, such as some kinds of magic, or resting, can restore health.

- When healed, health gained cannot exceed maximum health.
- You may not gain health if you have died.

**Temporary health.** Some features grant temporary health to targets. These are not considered to be actual health, but are instead thought of as a sort of bubble or ward against harm.

- When you have temporary health, if you would take damage, the temporary health is always lost first. Any spillover carries to your health after your temporary health is exhausted.
- Healing and rest do not restore temporary health.
- Unless otherwise stated, temporary health vanishes at the end of your next long rest.
- Temporary health doesn't stack. If you gain temporary health from two sources, choose the highest of the two.
- If you have 0 health, temporary health will not resuscitate you, though it can protect you from additional harm.

**Damage types.** All damage sources specify what kind of damage they deal. Damage types don't have their own unique rules or systems, but other features or abilities rely on damage types for their functionality.
