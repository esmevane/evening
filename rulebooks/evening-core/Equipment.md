Your character's possessions are modeled by their *wealth*, and *assets*.

**Wealth.** Your character has access to a number of *wealth aptitudes*, usually through their origins or disciplines. Wealth aptitudes represent how exactly your character goes about obtaining and then managing the things they own, or using their wealth to their advantage. How apt (or inept) your character is at this is usually reflected in the number and kind of wealth aptitudes they have.

**Assets.** These actual things your character has available to them. Assets are *unrealized items*, which you track in abstract categories on your character sheet. In play, you start with no actual items until you need them for whatever reason. When you do, you *leverage your assets*, which is an action that turns your asset into an actual item on your character sheet if successful.

**Kinds of asset.** There are 5 kinds of asset, each tracked separately. Each kind of asset may be leveraged differently. 

- **Equipment.** Equipment may be leveraged to create adventuring gear, weaponry, armor, and other things mechanically useful when meeting challenges or in combat.
- **Lore.** Knowledge, secrets, and information. You accrue and broker these bits of insider info, leveraging them for secret caches, tips about the clandestine, and advantage on information gathering work.
- **Rarities.** Rarities are things like art, treasure, antiques, and things of that nature. Rarities seldom have use in and of themselves, but can be very valuable when attempting to trade or coerce.
- **Supplies.** Food, potions, camping gear and traveling utilities. Supplies are things you couldn't get by without. Supplies are typically used in travel or to weather times of scarcity.
- **Tooling.** Things which help you build, paint, create, and so on. If your character is an artist or an inventor, or a smith, or anything of that nature, tooling gives you the things you need to perform your craft.

**Value.** Assets have a value, which is represented as a number that begins at 0. Every time you obtain an asset, usually through gameplay, or through advancement or wealth checks, this number goes up. Whenever you successfully leverage an asset, this number goes down. If an asset has a value of 0, you don't have any of it and you can't leverage it.

**Asset base.** Some features or advancement perks increase your *base* asset value. Whenever you resolve a thread, if your asset value is lower than your base value, you recover the difference.

*Example:* Your supplies asset has a base of 2. Over the course of investigating a strange hovering castle, you leverage some of your supplies, bringing you down to 1. When you resolve the mystery of the strange castle, you begin your next session at your supplies base of 2, having recovered 1 asset.

**Gaining assets.** Whenever you gain an asset, you increase a given asset value. For example, if you gain 2 supply assets, increase your supplies by +2. You can gain assets a number of ways:

- After finishing a long rest, you may choose a wealth aptitude and make a check with it against a TN of 10. If successful, you gain one asset of your choice.
- Some features or progression kits often increase your base assets. Whenever your base assets go up, you gain an equal number of assets.
- You may spend 5 experience to increase an asset base by 1.
- You can earn assets through gameplay. For example, looting a ruin could bring you rarities and equipment.

**Asset maximum.** Your assets represent things you feasibly have on your person, and so they are capped. Unless otherwise stated by a feature, asset value only goes up to 5. Anything past this maximum represents something which you can't carry anymore. Either give it to another character, exchange it for something else, or leave it where you found it.

**Spending assets.** Assets are a resource that your character can spend for a number of benefits.

- Some actions, or undertakings, cost assets. For example, your narrator may require that you spend 1 supplies asset every day of travel unless your character is skilled at hunting or gathering.
- It's possible to trade or barter with assets, exchanging them during downtime or gameplay. This includes exchanging assets between characters.

Spending assets often represents barter, or liquidating assets for coin to trade or purchase with. Characters may pool their assets to afford costlier expenses. These actions are usually fine to abstract away into an out of character conversation: either your characters can or can't afford some expense, and the details aren't always important to play through.

*Example*: The characters want to purchase a hideout, which has an expense of 10. Everyone in the 5-character group chips in, spending 2 assets in order to buy the hideout.

**Leveraging assets.** You may leverage each kind of asset once per day, spending it in order to convert it into a real item or outcome of your choice which you would feasibly be able to have.

At any time, you may ask the narrator to leverage an asset, describing what you want to leverage the asset for. If the narrator approves that your character could plausibly have a given item or achieve a given outcome with the asset, you may make a wealth check to attempt to leverage the asset.

The narrator decides on a target number which represents the difficulty of the wealth check. Roll 1d10 + your wealth aptitude bonus + any other relevant modifier against this target number. If you succeed, mark off one from the leveraged asset, gaining the item or achieving your desired outcome.

If you leveraged the asset for an item you now carry, write it down on your inventory portion of your character sheet and increase your load accordingly.

You may not leverage an asset at 0, and you may not leverage any assets if your load is at maximum capacity.

**Load.** Load is an abstract number that represents what you're carrying. Everything you can stow in your inventory has a load value from 0 to 3.

- 0 load is miniscule. You can carry an absurd amount of these.
- 1 load is a small item, easy to stow.
- 2 load is a somewhat cumbersome item. It's noticeable to others that you're carrying it.
- 3 load is a large, bulky thing, which is incredibly obvious and difficult to stow.

To figure out your total load, tally up the combined load of everything your character carries. Your load can't exceed your load capacity.

**Load capacity.** Your load capacity is an abstract number that limits what you can carry. It starts at 4 + [[Prowess]] + [[Body]], and has no cap, with a minimum of a load capacity of 2.

**Gaining load.** Your load starts at 0. Whenever you decide to carry an item or leverage an asset into an item, add that item's load to your load total. If carrying that item would make your load total exceed your load capacity, you either need to give up some items to make room, or you simply can't carry the item.
