What happens when your characters are in danger, and they could die, but it isn't exactly an active threat that they can attack? For these, we use **dangers**, which are hybrids of [[Threats|threats]] and [[Challenges|challenges]] that give you tools to depict the treacherousness of threats but with the resolution mechanics of challenges.

**Facing a danger.** Dangers are time-sensitive races and use initiative. When you face a threat, join iniative.

### Danger Rating

Dangers have a rating from 1-10. Like threats, rating sets a baseline for how deadly the danger is, and the base target number to avoid its attacks, and its base damage.

**TN.** Defense checks to avoid attacks from a danger are made against its TN.

**Attacks.** How many attacks the danger can make every round. How these attacks work are entirely up to you. Dangers aren't necessarily active antagonists, so "attacks" in this sense means, in essence, "things that can hurt the characters". Explosions, falling stones, etc.

**Damage per attack.** Whenever a single-target attack lands, this is the damage it does.

### Complexity

Resolving a danger is more like resolving a challenge than it is like engaging in combat with a threat, and so dangers have complexity. This works exactly like it does for challenges.

### Customizing Damage

To flavor the danger of your danger, you might want to change how its attacks work.

**Melee or ranged.** The range on any of these attacks can change without impacting things much.

**Multiple targets.** If an attack should damage multiple targets, halve the damage it does.

**Certain damage.** If an attack is unavoidable, halve the damage it does, and give characters the chance to make a defense check to halve the damage again.

**Boosting damage.** The amount of attacks aren't set in stone. Combine attacks together to create larger damage attacks. For example, a danger with 3 attacks at 3d6+4, can be edited to become a danger with 2 attacks, one at 6d6+8 and another at 3d6+4, without upsetting balance. 

**Exchanging damage.** Move dice and modifiers around between attacks. If a danger has 3 attacks at 3d6+4, change that into one at 5d6+6, one 3d6+4, and one 1d6+2.

**Damage types.** You can make this damage any damage type you like, or any mixture of types. Fire and cold? Go for it.
