Every character brings something unique to the table, regardless of their origins. Different skills and approaches, different roles to play, and everyone changes the overall mix of their peers in their own way. Character classes are the part of [[Progression|feature progression]] which describe the distinct way in which a character interacts with the overall setting and game world. 

**At first level.** At first level, you gain one class rank. You also gain the class kit of the first class you select with this rank.

**At higher levels.** As your character level progresses, you gain additional class ranks. 
 You gain additional class ranks at 5th, 9th, 13th, 17th, and 20th level. You can spend those to increase the rank of your current class or you can choose to purchase a rank in a new class that you are qualified for.

**Multi-class.** You have no limit on the number of classes you may put ranks in, except for the requirements of those classes, if any, and the number of total classes ranks you have earned.

**Changing classes.** Whenever you gain a new class rank, you may also exchange one class rank that you have already spent for a different class which you qualify for.

**Anatomy of a class.** Classes represent the way your character interacts with the game and setting worlds. Their overall anatomy is tailored to this function. When creating your own classes, use this as your starting point.

*Name.* Classes each have their own name, which reflects the role the class takes.

*Description.* An overview of the class, describing what they are, how they work, what they do, and how they fit into the world.

*Blueprint.* Classes occupy a special space within the game world, and in order to reflect that, they come with a blueprint unique to the class. This blueprint alters how the class interacts with the world, and reflects the playstyle, mythos, and role of the class. Class blueprints often lay foundations for the mechanics of the class, and the class may have features that rely on its blueprint.

*Class kits.* A class kit is a set of bonuses that a character receives if they take the class when they choose their firs class rank at character level 1. It has the following:

- *Starting health.* The base health this class grants to a character, plus ([[Resolve]] + [[Body]]) x3.
- *Starting assets.* +2 to one asset, and +1 to a second, different asset.
- *Aptitudes.* A list of 3 aptitudes. When recording this kit, the player may choose +1 aptitude from this list.

*Class progression.* Classes give bonuses to characters as they invest class ranks in them.

- *Health.* Whenever a character increases their class rank, their health increases by this amount. This is a die, plus ([[Resolve]] + [[Body]]).
- *Reserves.* Every time a character increases their class rank, they gain an additional reserve die. This die is the same kind of die as the health die rolled.
- *Features.* Classes have features which they grant to characters. These are specific to the class. Class features are typically integrated with the mechanics of its blueprint, and establish a play style empowered by that blueprint.
