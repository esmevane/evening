Every character is different, and brings different skills and approaches, and abilities, to the mix. Classes are the part of [[Progression|progression]] which represents that. Classes help establish your features and define how you interact with the game world.

**Format.** Your character class decides the structured gameplay format you want to play. When beginning a session, your group will either be in an existing format phase or in downtime. Character classes each bring a format to the menu of options for your next group outing.

**At first level.** At first level, you gain one class level. You also gain the class kit of the class you select.

**At higher levels.** As you progress, you gain additional class levels at 5th, 9th, 13th, 17th, and 20th character level. You can spend those to increase the level of your current class or you can choose to purchase a level in a new class that you are qualified for.

**Multi-class.** You may pick to advance any class you like whenever you spend a class level, provided you qualify for that class.

**Re-designing your class.** Whenever you would gain a class level, you may exchange one class level that you have already spent for a different class that you qualify for.
