Harm your character endures is typically managed by their health score, but health is fluid. It comes and goes throughout the day. Long-lasting harm that your character carries with them is *injury*. Injury represents your character's physical condition.

Injury is typically caused only by major moments, such as story actions or deliberately through some feature or mechanic. Unlike exhaustion, you don't gradually become more injured by staying up too late.

**Levels of injury.**  Injury is measured in levels, from 0 to 7. Every time you gain a level of injury, that number goes up. Whenever you reach a new level, you suffer an additional penalty as a result, outlined by the level.

**Recovery.** Injury gradually goes away on its own with time and rest.

In order to heal one level of injury, you must finish a number of long rests equal to the level of the injury. For example, to reduce your injury from 5 to 4, you would need to finish 5 long rests.

In addition to time, healing works: some healing features or actions can accelerate recovery from injury considerably.
