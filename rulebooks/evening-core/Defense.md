Whenever you want to avoid or endure danger–getting out of the way of something, shrugging off poisons, blocking attacks–you use your defenses. Defenses are proactive, you find your character's relevant stats, add them up and make a check, adding them to your result.

**Defense check formula.**  Your defense check is the result of a d20, plus an Ability + Attribute + Aptitude Bonus (conditional) + Defense modifier

**Applying abilities and attributes.** You add your ability and attribute to defense checks. Many features and conditions call out how they may be resisted, and other times the narrator will simply ask for a specific kind of defense.

Some example defense checks:

- Fortitude-based defenses use **Resolve + Body**.
- Reflex-based defenses use **Finesse + Body**.
- Will-based defenses use **Resolve + Mind**.

**Applying aptitudes.** Some aptitudes specify circumstances where they'll apply to your defense checks. Whenever that applies, you may add your aptitude bonus to your defense check.

**Defend for half.** If something says "defend for half", a successful defense doesn't negate the effect, it merely reduces it by half (rounding down).

**Circumstantial bonuses.** Sometimes outside effects apply to your defense result, reducing the target number of the defense check.

- A **limited circumstance** reduces the target number by 3.
- A **standard circumstance** reduces the target number by 6.
- A **great circumstance** reduces the target number by 9.

For example, seeking cover from incoming arrows: if you can get half-cover, that would be *limited*, while three-quarters would be *standard*, and full cover would be *great*.
