**Preamble.** I'm painfully gifted at egomaniacal ranting and, God, I'd love to spare anyone reading this from that. At the same time, I have to talk about what I'm trying to do *somewhere*. That's here.

---

The overall goal of this effort is to get a tactical-play friendly fantasy heroism game system put together. I'm trying to hit the following design beats:

- Story and combat should be equally featured as stars of the system. That means narrative stuff levels you up, but so does killing monsters, and so does exploring things.
- I want to reduce narrator (GM) work as much as possible. That means I want the game to help out with session prep organically. It also means that game formats, like Blades in the Dark's play style, strongly influenced me.
- I also want to reduce player work in one regard: bookkeeping. The vast bulk of items and equipment and stuff like that, that's going out.
- Mechanically it is a hybrid of 5E and Blades in the Dark. Like, literally. I'll be citing both in the intro as required by the license.
- Ultimately it's all for Hanging Towers, I'm just calling the system "Towers" even.

The Hanging Towers itself is bombastic and over the top. I'm aiming strongly for a late 70s / early 80s Heavy Metal and bold sci-fi novel aesthetic. I'm putting it in a fantasy setting that dwells mainly in the cosmopolite distant future of a thoroughly strange world that beat its apocalypse with the power of magical science.

Gods exist, and they're really too big for reality to contain. So, their presence splinters time and space: as soon as they existed, they *always existed*. As far as they're concerned, they're stuck. It pisses them off, and they'd like to shatter reality except they can't, because, again, magical people stopped them.

All of this to get back to the point of the system: every day people have just a crazy amount of casual magic at their disposal. "Baby God" is a class. Well, no, it's *several* classes.

Towers needs to be able to accommodate that in a fun way, so a lot of the typical concerns like balance or modest power growth scales? Not useful. Balance should take a back seat to cool factor and fun (while of course bearing in mind that really unabalanced stuff isn't fun).

So, again:

- Tactical structure
- Narration is significant
- Embraces fantasy tropes
- Works to reduce paperwork
- Works to reduce prep / narration work
- Cool / fun things
- Over the top is ok
- Hybrid of 5E and Blades in the Dark

Designing **origins**. Origins can mean a lot, they're a very loaded space, consider the following kinds of origins:

- Origins as "the species you are"
- Origins as "the ancient divine lineage you have"
- Origins as "the culture which you most align with"

And so on. So, what do we do to resolve the "origin problem"? So they don't all feel the same? Here's what we do: we make the three kinds above into structural patterns.

- Ancestral (species) origins are mostly going to give you features (feats).
- Lineage origins are tracks of power with 5 levels.
- Cultural origins are resource and asset heavy, and give you cultural tools.

Concept space: assets, resources, wealth, gear.

Equipment has been kept deliberately slim, but the space here is positively full of good design potential.

- **Assets** are temporary stats that you "spend" to get perks.
- **Resources** are your relationships with organizations and very storyteller background-esque things.
- **Wealth** represents your accrued money and assets. It gradually increases as you level up, and works like an aptitude bonus for asset checks.
- **Gear** is a weapons/armor concept that sticks with you as you level. Narrative items.

Right now, you get your share of these from your expertise. That means your expertise is parallel to your job / career.

- [x] Rename expertise -> career?
