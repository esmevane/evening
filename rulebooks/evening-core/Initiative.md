There are points of intense action where everyone wants to act at the same time. In order to let everyone have their turn, when those moments happen, everyone rolls initiative and begins to take turns.

**When to use initiative.** Initiative is useful whenever people need to take turns and not just clamor to be the one to say what they're doing first. At *any* time someone abruptly tries to "beat someone else" by saying an action first, pause play and ask for initiative.

Characters move at different speeds from our real life selves, and initiative models that.

Scenarios where initiative applies:

- Combat.
- Races of any kind.
- Intense arguments where rolling is involved.
- Games where turns might be significant.

**The initiative roll.** This is a d20 + [[Finesse]] check. Everyone involved rolls, and order is determined from highest to lowest. Ties roll off against each other until an order emerges.

**Joining initiative.** In order to join an existing initiative, you must roll initiative, and then your first action happens when that initiative is reached.

**Surprise.** In cases where some parties joining initiative have established they are catching others off-guard–for example, ambushes–then those parties gain a *surprise round*. Everyone rolls initiative normally, but the surprised parties may not act until the surprise round is over and they've begun their first turn.

**The countdown.** Initiative proceeds from highest to lowest. When your initiative is up, you may take your turn. Rounds end when everyone has taken their turn. If the initiative is still ongoing, initiative cycles back to the highest and proceeds again.

**Rounds.** Initiative splits action into *rounds*, which are roughly six seconds in length. Narratively, everyone participating in a round is acting at once, even though initiative dictates the order of resolution.

**Turns.** Everyone who rolls initiative gets to take a turn every round. Your turn begins on your initiative.

**Movement and actions.** During your turn, you may take one action, and make one movement.

**Bonus action.** Many features will mention that they may be used during a bonus action. This action is in addition to your action and movement, and must be used during your turn.

**Reactions.** Some features and kinds of actions specify that they may be used as a reaction. This action is also in addition to your other actions and movement. You may use a reaction during your turn or during someone else's. You may not use your reaction before your first turn.

**Free actions.** Some things don't require a roll or much time. Object interactions, speech, and so on. These are called *free actions*. You may use one free action of each kind per turn. For example, you can speak once, you may interact with an object once, etc.

**Initiative actions.** There are several actions you can take any time you are in initiative play.

- **Interact.** As a free action, you may interact with an object, such as flipping a switch, or picking up a trinket.
- **Ready.** You choose an action available to you, and then you specify a trigger that will cause you to take the action. If the trigger occurs before your next turn, you may use your reaction to take the readied action.
