Disciplines are areas of particular interest or study that you have begun to excel at to such a degree that you've become known for it. Disciplines are part of the [[Progression|progression]] of characters which reflects voluntary training and discipline.

**At first level.** At second level, you gain one discipline level. You also gain the discipline kit of the discipline you select.

**At higher levels.** As you progress, you gain additional discipline levels at 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th character level. You can spend those to increase the level of a discipline you already have or you can choose to purchase a new discipline which you are qualified for.

**Multi-discipline.** You may pick to advance any discipline you like whenever you spend a discipline level.

**Re-designing your disciplines.** Whenever you would gain a discipline level, you may exchange one discipline level that you have already purchased for a different discipline that you qualify for. You have learned something new and chosen to put aside something you no longer wish to do.
