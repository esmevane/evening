[[README|Home]]

The written materials for Evening and any other stuff for Evening finds its home here.

## How This Area Works

Hopefully this is pretty straightforward. Here, sections are kept in a folder, for example, `evening-core`, and then the sections are collated into files next to this one, for example, `Evening Core`.

Lots of embeds and linked content.

## Rulebooks So Far

## Using Rulebooks

Rulebooks work the way they do so that it's easy to make PDFs of them. Just go to the collection files in Obsidian and click "Save as PDF" in the top right kebab menu.
